        "content": "Technical Assistance by Consulting Agency For Implementation Of State Wide Area Network (SWAN) Jan2006 Department of Information Technology, Govt. of India, Electronics Niketan, New Delhi –110 003. Technical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI -2-1.Background The National e -Governance Plan (NEGP ) of Government of India has a clear focus on improving delivery of government services to citizens. Towards this end, it has identified several Mission Mode Projects (MMP s) both at the Central and State levels, aimed at readying various central and state government departments and organizations for electronic delivery of services including several other e -Governance initiatives also being undertaken by the State governments and the Central Ministr ies. NEGP recognizes that creation of independent infrastruc ture required to ensure service delivery by each department is neither cost -effective for government nor convenient for the citizen . Considering the need for creating reliable access network throughout the country, State Wide Area Network (SWAN) has been i dentified as one of the MMPs under the NEGP. Department of Information Technology (DIT), Government of India is the nodal department for SWAN MMP and Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the SWAN Scheme for implementation in 29 States and 6 Union Territories. The SWAN Scheme proposes to establish a minimum 2 Mbps connectivity up to the block level through extension and /orcreation of NICNET/ State Wide Area Networks (SWANs) across the country. The SWAN Policy Guidelines formulated by D IT provide sStates with two options for implementing SWAN and these options are detailed below. Option I: State to identify a suitable PPP model (BOO, BOOT etc.), select an appropriate agency through a suitable competitive process for outsourcing establish ment, operation and maintenance of the SWAN . The State will need to designate an appropriate nodal agency to take overall responsibility for receipt of funding support, implementation and rendering accounts/ Utilization Certificates. The entire process of outsourcing, including advising on the most appropriate PPP model, could be managed by an appropriate consultancy organization to be engaged by the designated agency through a transparent process under the direction of an implementation committee to be est ablished by the State. Option II : Designate NIC as the prime implementation agency for establishment and maintenance of the SWAN , with an appropriate end -to-end Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this alternative, funds would be released to NICSI by Departm ent of IT and execution would be carried out by NIC. Given the importance and the intricacies involved in implementing SWAN (especially through Option I), many States have voiced the need for technical assistance through appointment of Consulting Agency fo r supporting them in this initiative . Considering the implementation requirements of SWAN, the technical assistance which may be provided by the consultants can be segregated into three distinct areas relating to: Project Conceptualization; Preparation of Detailed Project Report, Request for Proposal (RFP) for selection of the SWAN Operator andthe related Service Level Agreements (SLAs) . Technical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI -3-Implementation assistance including support in bid process management, selection of Network Operator and Project Monitor ing during Implementation Network Monitoring for ensuring SWAN performance in compliance withSLAs Thesebroad Guidelines have been prepared in order to: assist State Governments in defining the role and responsibilities of the Project Consultants in various phases of SWAN project ; document the various options available to the State Governments for engaging the services of the Consulting Agency for various elements of work as outlined above and document the p ossible Payment Terms for such consulting assign ments 2.Role of the Project Consultants under SWAN Considering the size and complexity of the SWAN implementation exercise, the role of Project Consultants can be segregated into three phases. The choice of whether a single Agency is to be hired upfront to u ndertake all the three phases or whether separate project consultant for each phase could be hired , isleft to the discretion of the State Governments. It may be mentioned though that since hiring of project consultants is often a time consuming activity ,it may be appropriate for the State Governments to hire services of a reputed agency for all the three phases subject to suitable Terms and Conditions for each phase. This would help State Governments to get the most competitive offers and advantage of tim e. The detailed Scope of Work to be performed by the selected consultants in each phase is described below. Depending on its readiness and requirement , the State may customise the Scope of Work suitably. 2.1Phase I –Project Conceptualization; Preparat ion of Detailed Project Report, and Service Level Agreements Suggested Time Period –6-8 weeks To make a preliminary assessment of the existing network Infrastructure of the State at all the levels including State head quarters, Districts, Taluks /Blocks.

Itis felt that assignments un der SWAN implementation are of technical nature and the other techno - administrative issues are critical to State and thus there may be a need to balance between the cost and quality. Keeping the same in view, QCBS and Least Cost Selection are the most appropriate methods. However, It is left to the discretion of the State Governments to choose one of the models suggested below for appointment of the Consulting Agency taking into account their own procedures and process. 3.1. Quality and Cost Based Selection (Q CBS) QCBS uses a competitive process among “short -listed” agencies that takes into account the quality of the proposal and the cost of the services in the selection of the successful firm. Cost as Technical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI -9-a factor of selection shall be used judiciously. The relati ve weight age to be given to the quality and cost shall be determined for each case depending on the nature of the assignment. Typically the ratio between quality and cost is 70:30. The evaluation of the proposals under this system shall be carried out in two stages: first the quality, and then the cost. Evaluators of technical proposals shall not have access to the financial proposals until the technical evaluation. Financial proposals shall be opened only thereafter. The quality evaluation shall be carrie d out in full conformity with the provisions of the RFP which would clearly state the process and weight age. State Governments can evaluate each technical proposal (using an Evaluation Committee of three or more specialists in the sector), taking into acc ount several criteria: (a) the Consultant's relevant experience for the assignment, (b) the quality of the methodology proposed, (c) the qualifications of the key staff proposed, (d) transfer of knowledge , and (e) the extent of participation among key staf f in the performance of the assignment. 3.1.1 At the end of the quality evaluation process, State Governments shall prepare an Evaluation Report onthe \"quality\" of the proposals. The report shall substantiate the results of the evaluation and describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposals. All records relating to the evaluation, such as individual mark sheets, shall be retained until completion of the project and its audit. After the evaluation of quality is completed, the State Governmen t shall notify those consultants whose proposals did not meet the minimum qualifying mark or were considered non responsive to the RFP and Scope of Work, indicating that their financial proposals will be returned unopened after completing the selection pro cess. State Governments shall simultaneously notify the consultants that have secured the minimum qualifying mark, and indicate the date and time set for opening the financial proposals. The financial proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of r epresentatives of the consultants who choose to attend. The name of the consultant, the quality scores, and the proposed prices shall be recorded when the financial proposals are opened. The total score shall be obtained by weighting the quality and cost s cores and adding them. The weight for the \"cost\" shall be pre -defined taking into account the complexity of the assignment and the relative importance of quality. 3.2. Quality -Based Selection (QBS) QBS is appropriate for the following types of assignments: comp lex or highly specialized assignments for which it is difficult to define precise TOR and the required input from the consultants assignments that have a high downstream impact and in which the objective is to have the best experts; and assignments that ca n be carried out in substantially different ways, such that p roposals will not be comparable 3.2.1 In QBS, the RFP may request submission of a technical proposal only (without the financial proposal), or request submission of both technical and financial p roposals at the same time, but in Technical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI -10-separate envelopes (two -envelope system). The RFP shall not provide the estimated budget, but it may provide the estimated number of key staff time, specifying that this information is given as an indication only, and that consultants shall be free to propose their own estimates. If technical proposals alone were invited, after evaluating the technical proposals using the same methodology as in QCBS, the State Government shall ask the Consultant with the highest ranked technical proposal to submit a detailed financial proposal. The State Government and the Consultant shall then negotiate the financial proposal and the contract. All other aspects of the selection process shall be identical to those of QCBS. If, however, cons ultants were requested to provide financial proposals initially together with the technical proposals, safeguards shall be built to ensure that the price envelope of only the selected proposal is opened and the rest returned unopened, after the negotiation s are successfully concluded. It may be noted that the above process requires significant expertise on behalf of the Government to undertake a proper technical evaluation so that subjectivity does not creep. This process also does not provide for cost comp etitiveness. 3.3. Selection under a Fixed Budget This method is appropriate only when the assignment is simple and can be precisely defined and also when the budget for consultancy is fixed. The RFP shall indicate the available budget and request the consultant s to provide their best technical and financial proposals in separate envelopes, within the budget. TOR should be particularly well prepared to make sure that the budget is sufficient for the consultants to perform the expected tasks. Evaluation of all tec hnical proposals shall be carried out first as in the QCBS method. Then the price envelopes shall be opened in public. Proposals that exceed the indicated budget shall be rejected. The Consultant who has submitted the highest ranked technical proposal amon g the rest shall be selected and invited to negotiate a contract. 3.4. Least -Cost Selection This method is more appropriate to selection of consultants for assignments of a standard or routine nature where well-established practices and standards exist, and in which the contract amount is small. Under this method, a \"minimum\" qualifying mark for the \"quality\" is established. Proposals to be submitted in two envelopes are invited from a short list. Technical envelopes are opened first and evaluated. Those securin g less than the minimum are rejected and the financial envelopes of the rest are opened in public. The firm with the lowest price shall then be selected. Under this method, the qualifying minimum mark shall be established, keeping in view that all proposal s above the minimum qualifying mark compete only on \"cost.\" The minimum mark shall be stated in the RFP. 3.5. Single -Source Selection Single -source selection of consultants does not provide the benefits of competition in regard to quality and cost. It lacks tr ansparency in selection, and could encourage unacceptable practices. Therefore, single -source selection shall be used only in exceptional cases. The justification for Technical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI -11-single -source selection shall be examined in the context of the overall interests of the State Government and the project 4.Suggested Payment Terms All the activities, being multifarious and involving numerous agencies, necessitate involvement of a competent, unbiased and professional consultant agency and a competent project manager to assist t he State Government. The responsibility lies with the State Government to select such a professional agency that can help them to achieve their objective of setting up the communication backbone network for e -governance applications. While t he State may co nsider adopting any of the models mentioned below for finalizing the payment terms (contract) to the project consulting agency based on its requirements & procedures, Firm Fixed Price Contract & Firm Fixed Price Contract/Time Based Contract are the most ap propriate ones for Phase I & II and Phase III respectively. 4.1. Lump Sum (Firm Fixed Price) Contract Lump sum contracts can be used in which the content and the duration of the services and the required output of the consultants are clearly defined (Phase I i n 7.1 & Phase II in Section 7.1). They are widely used for simple planning and feasibility studies, environmental studies, detailed design of standard or common structures, preparation of data processing systems, and so forth. Payments are linked to output s (deliverables), such as DPR, SLA, bills of quantities, bidding documents, etc. Lump sum contracts are easy to administer because payments are due on clearly specified outputs. 4.2. Time -Based Contract This type of contract is appropriate when it is difficul t to define the Scope and the length of services, either because the services are related to external activities by others for which the completion period may vary, or because the input of the consultants required to attain the objectives of the assignment is difficult to assess. This type of contract is widely used for complex studies, supervision of implementation (Phase II in 7.2 & Phase III inf Section 7.3 ), advisory services, and most training assignments. Payments are based on agreed hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly rates for staff (who are normally named in the contract) and on reimbursable items using actual expenses and/or agreed unit prices. The rates for staff include salary, social costs, overhead, fee (or profit), and, where appropriate, spec ial allowances. This type of contract shall include a maximum amount of total payments to be made to the consultants. This ceiling amount should include a contingency allowance for unforeseen work and duration, and provision for price adjustments, where ap propriate. Time -based contracts need to be closely monitored and administered by the client to ensure that the assignment is progressing satisfactorily, and payments claimed by the consultants are appropriate. Technical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI -12-4.3. Retainer and/or Contingency (Success) Fee Co ntract The remuneration of the Consultant includes a retainer and a success fee, the latter being normally expressed as a percentage of a price. In the instant case, it could be applicable for Phase II & III, and it could be a percentage of the contract va lue. 4.4. Percentage Contract These contracts are commonly used only for architectural and construction services. They may be also used for procurement and project monitoring (Phase III). Percentage contracts directly relate the fees paid to the Consultant to the estimated or actual project construction cost, or the cost of the goods procured or inspected. The contracts are negotiated on the basis of market norms for the services and/or estimated staff -month costs for the services, or competitively bid. 4.5. Indef inite Delivery Contract (Price Agreement) These contracts are used to have \"on call\" specialized services to provide advice on a particular activity, the extent and timing of which cannot be defined in advance. These are commonly used to retain \"advisers\" normally for a period of a year or more. The State Government and the agency have to agree on the unit rates to be paid for the experts, and payments are made on the basis of the time actually used."

PREAMBLE 1.1. Electronics industry is the world’s largest and fas test growing industry and is increasingly finding applications in all sectors of the economy. The Gov ernment attaches high priority to electronics hardware manufacturing and it is one of the importa nt pillars of both “Make in India” and “Digital India” programmes of Government of India. Besides t he economic imperative, focus on electronics hardware manufacturing up to the integrated circuit or chip level is required due to the growing security concerns. The ESDM industry is of strategi c importance as well. India is a signatory to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA-1) of WTO and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with various countries/ trading blocs such as ASEAN, Kor ea and Japan. However, the electronics hardware manufacturing sector faces lack of level p laying field vis-à-vis competing nations on account of several disabilities which render domest ic electronics hardware manufacturing uncompetitive. These inter-alia include lack of adequate infrastructure, domestic supply chain and logistics; high cost of finance; inadequate availab ility of quality power; inadequate components manufacturing base; limited design capabilities and focus on R&D by the industry; and inadequacies in skill development. 1.2. Building India’s capacity in core technology develo pment (Design and Intellectual Property (IP)) requires deeper consideration. It is noteworthy tha t standards development, product design or IP development (semiconductor/ systems) and semiconduc tor manufacturing are increasingly becoming important and improving India’s participat ion in this league must be a major priority for the country, at least from the national security an gle. In the case of building Design and IP based technology companies, the large investments needed and difficulty in competing with established Multinational Corporations (MNCs) is a significant barrier. Building semiconductor fabrication capabilities in India is essential to break into th is segment. 1Hkkx Iμ[k.M 1o Hkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k 17 1.3. Recognizing the electronics sector’s unique dynamic s, significant opportunities, and structural challenges, the Government of India notified the Na tional Policy on Electronics in 2012 (NPE 2012), which provided a road map for the developmen t of electronics sector in the country. The Policy is holistic, investor-friendly and market-dr iven, and focused on upgradation of infrastructure, providing incentives to offset disa bilities, promoting innovation and human resource development. Schemes such as Modified Special Incen tive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) to provide financial incentives across the ESDM value chain to compensate for cost disability in manufacturing; Electronics Manufacturing Clusters ( EMC) for providing world-class infrastructure and logistics; mandating safety standards; rational ization of tariff structure and providing preference to domestically manufactured electronic products in Government procurement under the aegis of the Public Procurement Order 2017, are under implementation. As a result, ESDM industry has witnessed significant upward growth in India and has the potential to become a vehicle of economic growth and development. 1.4. The Modified Special Incentive Package scheme (M-SI PS), launched in 2012, provides capital subsidy of 25% for electronics industry located in non-SEZ areas and 20% for those in SEZ areas. Under M-SIPS, 419 investment proposals involving in vestment of INR 1,13,089 crore have been received till 31.12.2018. Out of these 419 applicat ions, 197 applications with proposed investment of approximately INR 41,791 crore have been approve d; 19 applications with proposed investment of approximately INR 14,764 crore have been recomme nded by the Appraisal Committee for approval and 203 applications with proposed investm ent of INR 56,534 crore are under appraisal. Out of 197 units which have been approved, 134 unit s have commenced commercial production. Total capital investment reported by these companie s is INR 9,961 crore. These 134 units have reported total sales of INR 74,921 crore, out of wh ich goods worth INR 16,418 crore have been exported. The revenue paid to the Government on pro duction by these units is INR 9,020 crore. As per Quarterly Progress Reports received from approv ed applicants, employment generated by these units so far is 66,555 (direct and indirect). The Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme , also launched in 2012, encouraged entities, including State Government entities, to p rovide good quality infrastructure within a cluster. Under the scheme, 50% of the project cost for Greenfield EMC and 75% for Brownfield EMC is given as grant. So far, 20 Greenfield EMCs a nd 3 Brownfield EMC projects have been sanctioned with the project outlay of INR 3,898 cro re, including INR 1,577 crore from the Government of India as Grant-in-aid. Under this sch eme, 3,565 acres of land is being developed in Electronics Manufacturing Clusters with likely inve stment of about INR 54,836 crore by the manufacturers. 18 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [P ART I—S EC . 1)] In order to promote startups and innovation, a sche me called Electronics Development Fund (EDF) was launched. EDF is a Fund of Funds which invests in Venture Funds, which in turn invests in ventures/ Startups in the area of Electronics, Nano -electronics and IT. At least 50% of the corpus has to be invested in Ventures working in ESDM sect or. EDF will be investing in 13 Daughter Funds. The total targeted corpus of these 13 Daught er Funds is INR 6,950 crore and the amount committed by EDF to these 13 Daughter Funds is INR 857 crore. 1.5. The global electronics production is estimated to b e USD 2 trillion (approximately INR 1,30,00,000 crore) in 2017. Indian electronics hard ware production has increased from INR 1,90,366 crore in 2014-15 to INR 3,87,525 crore (ap proximately USD 59 billion) in 2017-18, registering a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 26.7%, as against a growth rate of 5.5% in 2014-15. India’s share in the global hardware el ectronics production is about 3%. The share of domestic electronics production in India’s GDP is 2 .3%. The import of electronic goods was of the order of USD 53 billion (approximately INR 3,44,500 crore) in 2017-18. With the demand for electronics hardware expected to rise rapidly to ab out USD 400 billion (approximately INR 26,00,000 crore) by 2025, India cannot afford to be ar a huge foreign exchange outgo on import of electronics alone. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the electronics sector. Opportunity to be a global leader and challenge to address a severe Balance of Payments (BoP) problem, which cannot be addressed by manufacturing for India alone. This calls for measures to promote large eco-system for domestic manufacturing , a special emphasis on exports and increasing domestic value addition. Specific policy initiatives are required to meet these objectives. 1.6. The production of Mobile Handsets, LCD/ LED TVs and Light Emitting Diode (LED) Products in the country has gone up significantly, and over the last few years, the demand of these electronic products is increasingly being met out of domestic production. The production of LCD/ LED TVs has gone up from 0.87 crore units in 2014-15 to 1.6 crore units in 2017-18. The production of Light Emitting Diode (LED) Products has gone up fro m INR 2,172 crore in 2014-15 to INR 9,630 crore in 2017-18.

Environment Scanning and Compet itiveness of Electronics and IT Hardware Industry 1.1. Overview of the Global Electronics Industry The global Electronics Hardware and Information Te chnology (IT) industry is valued at US $ 2.5 billion. Out of this, the global Electronics Hardware industry1 had a production of US $ 1.85 trillion in 2008. This is expected to reach US $ 1.86 trillion in 20092. While the industry was on a growth path, the recent rapid growth in indu stry production which was the result of strong consumer spending backed by economic expansi on in emerging economies came to a sudden halt in 2008. It is expected that 2009 would see a si ngle digit growth unlike the double digit growth witnessed in the past. The global market size and major segments are indicated below. Figure 1: World electronics hardware production an d major segments (in US $ billion) Source: Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JETIA) and IMaCS analysis However, despite the current downturn, it is exp ected that the global Electronics Hardware industry has a potential to clock US $ 3.2 trillion3 in revenues in the next five years growing at a CAGR of about 9.5% once the economy recovers. 1 Net of IT solution services 2 Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JETIA) 3 BCC Research 250 253 256345 347 349481 479 490138 137 138231 219 216127 128 133311 288 285 0200400600800100012001400160018002000 2007 2009 (E) 2009 (F)US $ billionSemiconductors Display devices Electronic components Other electronic equipment Computers and information terminals Communications equipment AV equipment Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 6 of 49 The US is the market leader with a share of 26 % followed by Japan with a share of 19%.

Skill Pyramid for the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Given that the industry would required a varied prof ile of skill sets, the following figure presents an overview of the profile of skill requirements as de rived from human resource requirements across different sectors of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 45 of 49 Figure 22: Skill Pyramid for the Elect ronics and IT Hardware Industry Source: Industry inputs, IMaCS analysis The skill pyramid, in summary, captures where th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry stands relatively in terms of skills (a function of ac tivity, educational requirements, and amount of ‘preparatory’ time required to inculcate a specifi c skill) as compared to all other industries. As can be observed, ‘Skill Levels 2 and 3’ , have the highest incremental requirement of human resource. This indicates the requirement for persons trained in manufacturing, servicing, and sales functions in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. 2.6. Emerging Trends in Electronics and IT Hardware Industry and Implications on Human Resource and Skill Requirements The following are some of the emerging trends in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry:  Increasing consumption and potential for production: The expected stead y increase in the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFC E) on Home Appliances, Recreational and Education Services, both ranging between 13% and 15%, is expected to drive the consumption and production of Electronics and IT Hardware. This is expected to drive industry/production growth at about 17%, w ith major contributors being Computers, Consumer Electronics, and Telecom.  Sales and Service Ecosystem as a driver of employment: The sales and service support functions are expected to generate an incr emental employment of 1.2 million persons till 4% to 5% Skill Level 4 (skills which are highly specialised involving research and design) Skill Level 3 (skills which require long drawn preparation as demonstrated by acquisition of degrees, and involve highly technical or il i ) Skill Level 2 (skills which require technical training inputs, knowledge of complex operations and machinery, skills of supervision) Skill Level 1 (skills which can be acquired with a short/modular and focussed intervention and thereby enhancing employability of those with minimal education) 49% to 50% 25% to 27% 19% to 21% Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 46 of 49 2022. This would be due to a large nation-wi de footprint of tier-2 and tier-3 industry participants (dealers, franchisees, service agenci es, etc.). This ‘ecosystem’ would contribute to a large portion of the human resource requirement.  Manufacturing has potential for increasing localisation: While a large portion of manufacturing is actually currently a combination of sourcing and assembly, increasing content would be locally manufactured – for example, passive components, certain active components, more complex motherboards, increasing adoption of Surface Mounted Technologies and other high-tech areas. Certai n components such as CRT based picture tubes may eventually see a reduction in production given the increasing adoption of LCD/Plasma displays. Incremental employment in manufacturing is likely to be 1.5 million till 2022.  Increasing adoption of E-Waste Management (electronic waste management) driven by regulation is likely to see more ‘organi sation’ of the industry in that space.  Global trends such as green and energy efficient t echnology is likely to have increasing adoption in India too.  Increasing contract manufacturing an d stronger OEM-supplier relationships would also be a key success factor towards developing a bette r ecosystem. There is a strong case for cluster development in this sector.  Growing segments would be major contributors to employment: Segments such as Consumer Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecom Equipment would be major contributors for employment. Illustrative growth categories are: • Set Top Boxes • Mobile Handsets • Plasma/LCD TVs • PC assembly • End to End IT solutioning - assembling, inst allation, support at on-site and off-site, infrastructure management, emergence of newer technologies such as cloud-computing. 2.7.

        "content": "No-15035/4/2021/AU -HQ Unique Identification Authority of India (Aadhaar Usage Division) UIDAI HQs, Bangla Sahib Road, Behind Kali Mandir, Gole Market, New Delhi. 110001 Dated: 31stOctober, 2022 CIRCULAR Subject: Usage of Aadhaar - Do’s & D on’ts for Offline Verification Seeking Entities ( OVSE s). Offline verification is the use of Aadhaar for carrying out identity verification and KYC process es locally, without connecting to the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) of UIDAI. The organizations cond ucting offline verification of an Aadhaar number holder for a lawful purpose are termed as Offline Verification Seeking Entities (OVSE). [Ref. Section ‘2 - Definitions’, Aadhaar (Authentication a nd Offline Verification) Regulations ] 2. There are two modes of offline verification, viz the Secure QR Code (displayed on Aadhaar letter, e -Aadhaar, Aadhaar PVC card and m -Aadhaar ) and the Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC XML (downloaded from the UIDAI website and m -Aadhaar ). Both the Secure QR Code and the Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC XML contain the resident’s data that is digitally signed by UIDAI. This is an essential security component that establish es the authenticity of the document , as presented by the resident seeking service from an OVSE. Scanning of secure QR code ( which includes validation of UIDAI’s digital signature) is possible using Aadhaar Secure QR code scanner application. This scanner application is freely available for both Android and iOS based mobile phones as well as Wi ndows based applications . The scanner is also available as part of UIDAI’s m - Aadhaar mobile application , for both Android and iOS phones . 3. Resident s may voluntarily use the Aadhaar number for a lawful purpose, to establish their identity by way of offline verification by an OVSE. For the purpose of offline verification by an OVSE, the Aadhaar number holder may use his/her Aadhaar either in (i) the physical form like Aadhaar letter (or copy thereof) or printed e -Aadhaar or Aadhaar PVC Card; or in (ii) the electronic form like e -Aadhaar/ Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC (XML)/ mAadhaar. 4. Following are the Dos and Don’ts to be followed by the OVSEs: (A) Dos:- i. Be courteous to residents. Assure the resident about the security & confidentiality of their Aadhaar being used for offline verification . ii. Be sure to carry out offline verification of Aadhaar (as per para 2 above) prior to accepting i t as proo f of identity. This applies to all modes o f offline usage of Aadhaar, ie. secure QR Code on Aadhaar Letter (or copy thereof) / e-Aadhaar/ m -Aadhaar or in the Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC (XML ), as the case may be . 2 iii. Carry out o ffline verification of Aadhaar only for the lawful purpose specified to the Aadhaar number holder along with his/ her explicit consent for verification taken either in physical or electronic form . Maintain logs/ records of the consent for any future audit by UIDAI or any agency thereof. iv. Provide the resident, desirous of availing any service from OVSE, other viable alternative means of identification, in addition to Aadhaar, as required for rendering the service. v. Ensure that Aadhaar data collected is not shared with any entit y except in accordance with the Aadhaar Act and/or regulations thereof. vi. Ensure that no service is denied to any resident for refusing to or being unable to undergo offline verification of Aadhaar provided that the resident is able to identify himself/ herself through other viable alternative means, as suggested by the OVSE. vii. Ensure full cooperation to the Authority, or any agency appointed or authorized by it or any other authorized investigation agency, in case of any fraud investigation involving Aadhaar, viii. Do inform the Authority and the Aadhaar number holder, without undue d elay and in no case beyond 72 hours after having knowledge of misuse of any information or systems related to the Aadhaar framework or any compromise of Aadhaar related information. ix. Ensure strict compliance to the Aadhaar Act and R egulations and to any ot her directions received from UIDAI from time to time, with respect to obligations of OVSEs. (B) Don’ts: - i. Do not accept Aadhaar number, in physical or electronic form, as a proof of identity for a lawful purpose, without first verifying the digital signature of the Authority as provided in the Aadhaar Secure QR Code on Aadhaar Letter or e -Aadhaar or m -Aadhaar or Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC (XML), as the case may be. ii. Do not perform verification of Aadhaar without explicit consent of the Aadhaar number holder in the form & manner as prescribed. iii. Do not perform offline verification on behalf of any other entity or person. iv. Do not collect, use or store Aadhaar number or biometric information of the resident after having conducted offline verification of Aadhaar. Post verification, if the OVSE finds it necessary for any reason, to store a copy of Aadhaar letter/ e-Aadhaar, the OVSE must ensure that Aadhaar number is redacted/ ma sked and irretrievable t hrough any means by any entity, including by OVSE itself. --------- Sd/------- (Kuldeep Singh) Asstt.

I was given the huge responsibility to head this Task Force, comprising esteemed members from across the Indian ICTE value chain representing various Associations and leading Companies. This has been the first-of-its-kind of a joint DIT-Industry initiative setup in the spirit of co-operation. The task before us was to chart a vision for the industry and recommend a suitable strategy for sustaining and developing all segments of the value chain of the ICTE Sector in India for the next five years and beyond with concrete and implementable recommendations/action points as also for making the industry globally competitive. While drafting the report, a well-rounded analysis, not just of the various verticals of the industry, but also by size of the industry i.e. small, medium and large was kept in mind. The Task Force also looked at how IT could proliferate into rural India for an inclusive growth. We also closely looked at the multi-faceted dynamics of the industry including ensuring a healthy eco-system for the IT/electronics industry with equal focus on exports and domestic market development; focusing on social inclusion, especially the youth; changing the industry mindset from business models based on tax arbitration to one based on inherent strengths and increased value addition especially for products designed and made for India; standardising various aspects of applications and products; facilitating conducive environment for development/adoption of standards; gauging the requirements of the strategic sector for ICTE as also new products/application development; and strengthening the electronic component base as well as attracting new investments in the area. To fructify these visions, the Task Force further constituted three sub-groups namely, Software & Services; Electronics Systems Design & Manufacturing (ESDM); and the Strategic Electronics to come out with insights on these crucial sub-sectors of the ICTE value chain, while keeping issues such as infrastructure, domestic market development, employment generation, exports, impact of international agreements & transactions particularly in mind. I must thank my colleagues Mr B V Naidu, Mr Som Mittal and Mr Kiran Karnik for providing leadership to these sub-committees respectively. Further, the contribution from all the members of our taskforce as well as several of the industry leaders has helped us put the industry issues in the right perspective. I must also acknowledge the significant contribution of M/s Ernst & Young for their efforts and support in researching and compiling the reports on ESDM as also M/s McKisnsey & Company for the reports on Software and Services and the Strategic electronics. Lastly, this report could not have been completed without the guidance and support of Mr R Chandrashekhar, Secretary, Department of IT , Ministry of Communications & IT and his team of able officers. After months of strenuous efforts of each of the Task Force members, I am happy to place in your hands the final report of the task force. I am confident that the recommendations will lead to actions by the Government and the industry alike and pave the way for India to become a dominant player of ICTE in the world in the not so distant future. - Ajai Chowdhry, Chairperson 1 December 2009 2Task Force Task force to suggest measures to stimulate the growth of IT , ITES and Electronics Hardware Manufacturing Industry in the country 1.

Shri Vinnie Mehta, Executive Director, MAIT Member-Secretary Messages \u0018Vision Is there a mantra to propel India to the league of developed nations? India’s technological prowess can provide the much-needed wind to her sails for the arduous economic and social transformational voyage. While we have been very successful in IT/ITES exports, however, momentum alone does not characterize leadership. We must build on this initial success with the next level of aggressive growth in other domains of technology including electronics hardware systems and design. India needs to leverage its market size and identify market mechanisms and policy interventions for increasing its dominance of key verticals like IT hardware systems, telecom, consumer electronics, defense and strategic electronics. The need of the hour is to focus on building technology brands and IPs emerging out of India. We must target emerging markets and future technologies to capture market share and mindshare. Leveraging technology for citizen empowerment can also bring about India’s social transformation. One needs to ponder that in this age when success is defined by one’s ability to connect with systems, people and opportunities, why are the poor really poor? Is it that the digital divide is actually denying access to education, life skills and livelihood opportunities to keep them poor in a virtual age when physical infrastructure ceases to be a barrier? “We have to democratize learning,” says C K Prahalad, Paul and Ruth McCracken Distinguished University Professor at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. This would happen only if we democratize access. ‘Access for all’, as in ‘education for all’ should be a fundamental right of every Indian citizen; it is only though democratisation of information that we can empower the vast majority of our people, fundamental to all this is the need to create access to broadband, which due to its inherent capability to substitute all other physical means of access across borders of every kind. Much of the success in IT/ITES was due to favourable government policies, and the sector’s ability to actively capitalise on the business opportunities. Now, there is an opportunity to create an inflexion point for each of the segments of the IT industry, to grow and to make a positive impact on the inclusive growth agenda of the country. If we do not take decisive action today, we may miss the bus forever. In addition to the opportunity cost of potential loss of GDP and jobs, there is a huge strategic risk of dependence on competitor - nations for this high-tech and vital sector. Our success in IT/ITES would never be complete and would not touch the lives of masses without commensurate growth of electronics sector. Composite and integrated growth of both sectors – software and hardware, is the only route to make India a global technology powerhouse, which is the V ision of this report.u India should aspire to be a global ICTE powerhouse in its true sense. u IT/electronics industry can be one of the largest and fastest growing industries in Indian economy and contribute significantly to the GDP and employment. u IT/electronics exports have the pote-ntial to offset Oil import bill. Broadband should be available on ‘tap’ – like water & electricity. This should lead to u Access to Information (Search) u Access to Transactions (Pay per use applications, computing etc.) u Access to Interactivity (Social networks, exchanges etc.) Vision 2020 Access Digitization Education Healthcare Energy Security \u0018Executive Summary India has a large, vibrant and fast growing economy and has a large number of ‘young people’ in the employable age, which gives it an edge over the aging economies. India also has a vast pool of trained, English-speaking personnel. It currently produces about 3 million graduates every year, out of which, approximately 500,000 are engineers and IT professionals and another 40,000 have post-graduate degrees & diplomas in business management. We have seen remarkable success in the field of information technology and business process outsourcing over the past decade. Total export revenues earned by IT sector have grown to INR 212,500 crore (USD 46.3 billion) in 2008-09, at a CAGR of 35 per cent. IT-BPO sector too has grown to USD 12.4 billion in 2008-09, at a CAGR of 22 per cent. Electronics and strategic electronics are at a similar point of inflexion as the information technology IT/ITES industry was a decade ago. The current demand for electronics in India stands at USD 45 billion and is projected to grow to USD 125 billion by 2014 and to USD 400 billion by 2020. Further, the exports are expected to increase from the current USD 4 billion to USD 15 billion by 2014 and USD 80 billion by 2020. ICTE industry - electronic components, systems, telecom, software & services, and the strategic electronics sectors with its multiplier effect has the potential to play a very significant and strategic role in India’s modernization, its socio-economic transformation and safeguarding its national and energy security interests. GDP growth is closely linked to increased exports, attractiveness of India as a manufacturing destination, FDI, competitiveness of our manufacturing units. Digitizing, IT and Internet penetration will empower the people of India to receive, absorb & act on information faster, thereby opening a plethora of opportunities for growth. The report envisions transformation of India into a globally competitive nation with inclusive economic development by exploring opportunities in the ICTE sector and brings to light the challenges that need to be overcome. As the world economy is poised for a transformation in the next decade driven by both global and country-specific factors, in order to examine the challenges and opportunities that exist for the electronics and IT industry in India, some key attributes have been used as a “lens” to evaluate its positioning: Market potential Industry capabilities World class skills Regulatory environment Infrastructure and logistics Strategic need Using the above framework the report attempts to provide strategic insights into the industry and the need to reinvent business propositions and offerings, that can help penetrate the global markets not only on value and cost factors, but also customised to their needs. These offerings could be uniquely poised for the emerging markets of future like Africa, CIS, Middle East, etc. The key recommendations of the report are: REcoMMEnDa TionS RElEV anT FoR all ThE inDuSTR y SEgMEnTS Ensuring a Favourable Business Policy and Regulatory Environment Building Adequate Basic Business and Social Infrastructure Harnessing technology for driving greater efficiency, transparency and monitoring of e- governance projects and developmental projects targeting inclusive growth l lllll l ll 9Fostering a sustainable ecosystem for innovation, R&D and manufacturing Catalysing growth in domestic market Investing in education and skill development to create a sustainable pool of high calibre talent. Allowing access to funds for investments in R&D, Innovation and Brand India Encouraging ‘Made for India ‘designs, solutions and devices, local value addition and IP creation especially for developmental schemes, defence and strategic needs. ElEcTRonicS The Electronics industry in India is poised for high growth however there exist multiple challenges that need to be addressed to realize its true potential. Key among these are inadequate infrastructure, frequently changing tax structure, supply chain and logistics issues, inflexible labor laws, limited R&D focus, non-availability of funding mechanisms, limited focus on value addition and exports. Supply is not keeping pace with demand in India, resulting in ever-increasing imports from China, Taiwan, South Korea etc. Government’s long-term vision should augment the growth of domestic electronics manufacturing by special focus on this sector . Establish ‘National Electronics Mission’ – a nodal agency for the electronics industry within DIT and with direct interface to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The nodal agency would help in the synchronized functioning of the industry through effective coordination across ministries and government departments in the centre and the states and would enhance the ease of doing business. Nurturing established electronics manufacturing clusters and developing them into centres of excellence, while encouraging new ones. iT/iTES Over the last 10 years, the technology and BPO industry has been an engine of growth for the Indian economy, however the global economic downturn has impacted the growth trajectory of the industry. The IT/ITES industry, in this phase, has demonstrated maturity by reducing costs, focusing on newer markets, investing in sales, building domain expertise, enhancing operational excellence and improving thrust on customer centricity. However, as new megatrends continue to shape the global technology and outsourcing industry, continued support from the government is critical for the industry to retain its competitiveness and build for the next wave of growth. Establishing India as a trusted global hub for professional services - Managing Risks effectively Engaging in Global Trade Development and Actively Advocating Free Trade in Services Providing a competitive tax regime – extending Section 10A/10B and providing parity with SEZ scheme. Ensuring incentives under Section 10A/10 B and SEZ continue after the direct tax code is introduced STRa TEgic ElEcTRonicS Given the size of the opportunity for supplying hardware, software and services to the aerospace, defense and nuclear markets, locally and globally, there exists a huge opportunity yet to be tapped as these markets have been largely catered to by government agencies. To leverage some of the market trends and also exploit its core competencies, India should focus on: Areas with higher technology intensity Technology areas that need to be built domestically as it is unlikely to be transferred by global players Areas where the private sector can collaborate and provide superior execution capabilities to Defence Public Sector Units (DPSUs) such as fabrication l llll l l l ll l llExecutive Summary \u0018\u0018 Software and Services Sector 13Contents 1.

Executive Summary 1.1 BackgRounD India’s success in the field of information technology and business process outsourcing over the past decade remains unparalleled. Total export revenues earned by this sector have grown from INR 6,723 crore (USD 1.8 billion) in 1997-98 to INR 212,500 crore (USD 46.3 billion) in 2008-09, a CAGR of 35 per cent. The domestic IT-BPO sector is showing increased traction, too, with growth from USD 1.4 Billion in 1997-98 to USD 12.4 billion in 2008-09, a CAGR of 22 per cent. India – through its unique value proposition – cost effectiveness, abundant talent and maturing service delivery, has emerged as the cornerstone for this sector, steadily increasing its market share to over 50 per cent of the global sourcing industry. It is estimated that India-based resources account for about 60-70 per cent of the offshore delivery capacities available across the leading multinational IT-BPO players. Over the last 10 years, the technology and BPO industry has been an engine of growth for the Indian economy. Between 1998 and 2008, it quadrupled its share of India’s GDP and exports to 4 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. In addition, the industry has also had a strong multiplier effect on national GDP and consumer spending by way of capital expenditure, operating expenses and expenditure by the individuals employed in the industry . It has offset close to 65 per cent of India’ s cumulative net oil imports, strengthening India’ s foreign reserves. It has helped expand tertiary education significantly; the top seven states that account for about 90 per cent of industry have founded six to seven times more colleges than have other states. Between 1994 and 2005, the industry contributed up to 45 per cent of incremental urban jobs - including direct and indirect employment (~22 lacs directly and ~80 lacs indirectly). Focused on balanced regional growth and is rapidly expanding into Tier 2/Tier 3 cities – currently operating out of 45+ locations. The industry has set a precedent for talent practices in India through diversity, inclusive job environment, global career growth, and encouraged entrepreneurship and driven corporate social responsibility initiatives. It has created career opportunities for the youth in the country (70% of workforce is between the age of 26 to 35 years). In addition, the focus has been on extensive training and development (entry level training, support for tertiary education, scholarships, sabbaticals etc). The industry has enhanced India’s credibility as a business destination by forging relationships with 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies, generating immense savings for customers (in 2008 alone, global sourcing savings for customers amounted to an estimated USD 20 billion), and promoting a focus on quality (65 per cent of all CMM Level 5 firms are based in India). It has built the global brand for India as a knowledge economy. Global leaders, media and analysts have recognised the potential for India through the brand built by this sector. IT enabled solutions have helped government and industry enhance governance and efficiency .l l llll l l l Indian IT-BPO industry revenues, Software and related services, FY98-FY09 USD Bn FY 98FY 99FY 00FY 01FY 02FY 03FY 04FY 05FY 06FY 07FY 08 FY 09CAGR Exports 1.8 2.7 4.0 6.2 7.6 9.5 12.9 17.7 23.6 31.2 40.4 46.3 34.3% Domestic 1.4 1.6 1.9 2.5 2.6 3.0 3.8 4.8 6.7 8.2 11.7 12.4 22% Total 3.2 4.3 5.8 8.7 10.2 12.5 16.7 22.5 30.3 39.4 52.1 58.7 30.3% Source: NASSCOM 16The growth of the sector has led to tremendous pay-offs in terms of wealth creation and generation of high quality employment. Direct employment in the IT services and BPO segment touched nearly 2.2 million by the end of FY2009. This also translates to the creation of about 8 million indirect job opportunities attributed to the growth of this sector in diverse fields such as commercial and residential real estate, retail, hospitality and transportation, etc. While the sector has maintained a CAGR of over 30 percent in the past decade, the global economic downturn has impacted the growth trajectory of the industry which has declined to single digits in FY 2010. Industry analysts have estimated that the worldwide technology spending will decline by 3-5 percent in 2009 and being an export led sector with a key thrust on banking and financial services, exports are expected to grow by only 4-7%, domestic market by 15% leading to very limited new employment creation during the year. Along with the decline in global demand, many other low-cost countries are building a significant value proposition to challenge India’s leadership position aided by very enabling investment policies. The industry in this phase has demonstrated maturity by reducing costs, focusing on new markets, investing in sales and development, domain expertise, enhancing operational excellence and thrust on customer centricity. However, continued support from the government is critical for the industry to retain its competitiveness and build for the next wave of growth. As we look ahead, the industry recognises that the next 10-15 years will be fundamentally different from the past and driving the next wave of growth will require all the stakeholders to create an ambitious vision and focus on achieving that. Over the next decade, several global megatrends will shape the technology and BPO industry as they reshape the global economy. NASSCOM has carried out extensive research to understand the implications of the global megatrends and the changing global IT-BPO landscape (NASSCOM Perspectives 2020 report). The objective of this research was to identify opportunities that the industry can penetrate and provide strategic insights for the industry to reinvent business models and offerings that can transform global businesses through a well-defined customer value proposition. The research also articulates a vision for the sector to transform India through economic development and ICT-enabled solutions in healthcare, education, financial services and public services, which can drive the socio-economic inclusion of 30 million citizens each year. It also throws light on the opportunity at risk for the country and details a call to action for all the stakeholders — the industry, government and NASSCOM. Hence with increased GDP growth of emerging markets, and shrinking working age populations, these megatrends will present a new set of hitherto untapped opportunities that will include emergence of new verticals, service lines, geographic and customer segments. On the back of these trends, the addressable market opportunity for the IT-BPO sector is likely to expand from the current USD 500 billion to USD 1.5 trillion by 2020. India is fundamentally advantaged and uniquely positioned to sustain its global leadership position, grow its offshore IT-BPO industries at an annual rate of 13-14 per cent, sustain nearly 10 million direct jobs, and generate export revenues of about USD 175 billion by 2020 and domestic revenues of USD 50 billion by 2020. Additionally, this growth can be further accelerated to USD 310 billion through deep and enduring innovation by industry participants, and focused initiatives by all stakeholders. This represents an opportunity, capable of catapulting us into a high growth orbit. The transformational impact that this industry can achieve has the potential for India to not only achieve global leadership, but also build a truly inclusive growth environment in the country. Achieving these ambitious outcomes will require breakthrough collaboration amongst industry players, central and state governments, and NASSCOM – to ensure that appropriate actions required to maximize the global sourcing market potential and sustain India’s superiority as the preferred sourcing destination are executed in a timely manner.Software and Services Sector \u0018\u0018To that end, this note outlines the policy actions required in key areas such as 1) Developing high calibre talent pool 2) Building Adequate Basic, Business and Social Infrastructure 3) Ensuring a Favourable Business Policy and Regulatory Environment 4) Global Trade Development and Actively Advocating Free Trade in Services 5) Catalysing growth in domestic market 6) Fostering a Sustainable Ecosystem for Innovation and R&D 7) Establish India as a trusted global hub for professional services - Managing Risks effectively 8) Harnessing ICT for Inclusive and equitable growth. 1.2 REcoMMEnDa TionS While we have discussed the challenges and policy actions required in detail (section 5), there are some specific policy actions which need to be prioritized.

Of this, the market potential for services that may be sourced globally was estimated at USD 500 billion. The total value of IT-BPO sourced from offshore locations in 2008 was estimated at USD 89-93 billion. global offshore iT-BPo Market Potential While India holds a dominant share of the global offshore IT-BPO sector, yet, at USD 46.3 billion in 2008-09, Indian IT-BPO exports accounted for less than 2.8 percent of the global spend on IT-BPO. Over the next decade, the industry will be influenced by several global macro-economic, demographics, social, business and technological trends that will shape the face of global business. These trends include: Macroeconomic and demographic trends Shifting centres of economic activity–GDP of Asia and Europe will converge Working age population shrinking in key developed countries (e.g., Japan, Italy, US) Social and environmental trends Increased Internet and mobile connectivity transforming the way people live and interact Rapidly increasing consumption and associated supply gap in key natural resources (e.g., oil, water) creating need for resource efficiency and climate change solutions Business and technology trends Global economic crisis leading to major shift in industry structures and higher regulatory control Corporate boundaries being redefined (e.g., open innovation, extended supply chains, web of partnerships) Technology radically transforming the way traditional corporations and governments function This will lead to new opportunities for companies to capture new markets largely untapped so far. So far, the prime focus of the global sourcing industry has been on core markets- large enterprises from North America, Western Europe and Japan in verticals such as BFSI, telecom, retail, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and travel. While these core markets will continue to grow over the next 10 to 15 years, driven by growth in the cost base, the industry will be redefined along four key dimensions: new services in core markets: There is still further growth potential (beyond the cost-based growth) even in the core markets described above. The global sourcing industry has largely focused on cost reduction through replication of processes in low-cost locations. Going forward, the industry can propose additional services to these core markets in three ways: 1) offer beyond-cost services, e.g., revenue enhancement, capital avoidance; 2) suggest integrated manufacturing and services solutions e.g., end-to-end development of new auto parts; and 3) redesign and transform processes, leveraging automation. new verticals: Several verticals in developed countries, which have previously not globally sourced services, are expected to do so in the next wave of growth. Driven by the megatrends, at least four new verticals are expected to emerge by 2020 (public sector, healthcare providers, media and utilities). For example, due to increased spending requirements on healthcare and pensions as a result of aging populations, the public sector and healthcare providers will increasingly depend on technology and services providers for solutions to reduce the cost to serve. Also, energy companies and utilities will look for solutions to monitor and optimise their carbon footprint in line with emission requirements. new customer segments: Enabled by megatrends such as increased digital connectivity and the availability of new delivery platforms, the industry can expand its influence beyond large enterprises to SMBs. The emergence of new service offerings and business models (such as SaaS) will also allow players to serve smaller enterprises in an unconventional but profitable manner. The industry can also offer direct business-to-consumer services (such as financial, healthcare and travel services) to the emerging class of well-connected retail consumers.l l l l l ll l l l 20new geographies: As economic growth expands into new markets, Asia will bypass Europe as the second largest target market, led by India and China. On the back of greater adoption of technology and outsourcing by enterprises, BRIC markets will become a sizeable target domestic outsourcing market, with India and China accounting for almost 50 per cent of the opportunity.l Based on the four dimensions of growth outlined earlier, the total addressable market for domestic outsourcing and global sourcing is estimated to be USD 1500-1640 Billion by 2020, growing by 3 times over current levels. The growth in the addressable market by 2020 highlights several trends: An estimated 80 per cent of the growth in the addressable market will come from segments that have not been traditional markets for the industry The addressable market for BPO will exceed that of technology services by 2020 The BRIC domestic outsourcing opportunity will rival that of core geographies Innovation can create an additional opportunity (around USD 200 billion for solutions and products in three select areas alone - namely climate change solutions, clinical research and mobile applicationsl l ll Areas of Focus Drivers of India’s advantage Energy efficiency and climate changeSmart buildings (integrated BMS linked to outside environment, e.g., weather, light, smart HVAC, occupancy-based lighting) Smart grid solutions (user-level smart monitoring, automated T&D monitoring, load)l lGrowing carbon credits market Increasing domestic demand to reduce car- bon footprint (India’s carbon footprint from electricity generation will grow at a CAGR of 4%, double the global average CAGR of 2% from 2010 to 2020) Improving regulatory environmentl l l Mobile applications Internet offerings like search, mail, messenger on mobile platformSMS-based searches, applicationsMobile middleware solutions, roam- ing applications, SMS gatewaysl lllLarge domestic market Robust local ecosystem of companies, value chain players and investors Established IT resource pool & development infrastructurel l lSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Total addressable market for global sourcing and domestic outsourcing, 2020 Contd..Software and Services Sector 21Areas of Focus Drivers of India’s advantage Clinical research Target identification & validation Lead generation & optimisationClinical development & trialsData management & statistical Analysisl lllLower time-to market due to easy access to low-cost, large patient pool Availability of talent for high quality trials, data management Favourable regulations, domestic market and infrastructurel ll The outsourcing opportunity in climate change, mobile applications and clinical research could add over USD 200 billion to the total addressable market. India can have a distinctive impact in these areas including clinical trials and data analysis, Internet offerings on mobile platforms and creating smart grids for energy efficiency. If India is able to capture distinctive roles in these value chains, over USD 75 billion could be added to Indian technology and BPO exports by 2020. ThE DoMESTic oPPoRTuniTy The domestic technology and BPO industry in India is at an inflection point today. As India rapidly grows into one of the largest economies of the world, this will not only lead to the rise of personal consumption in the Indian middle class but also fuel the growth of several, large and global Fortune 500 companies of Indian origin. The increasing affluence of the Indian consumer and globalisation of Indian corporations will likely lead to increasing sophistication of domestic demand in product complexity, delivery flexibility and service levels. These trends will have significant impact in growing the size and scope of the domestic addressable market. As Indian consumers and corporations rapidly adopt mobile phones, and Internet access and broadband connectivity expand, there is likely to be a significant increase in spend on IT hardware, software and services. Finally, the biggest domestic opportunity in most sectors (e.g., banking, insurance, retail, telecom and healthcare) lies in tapping the opportunity to serve the billions of underserved at the bottom of the pyramid. India is likely to be the laboratory for disruptive innovations to serve these underserved segments at a price and performance profile that suits these conditions. Source: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020 The addressable domestic opportunity in India based on these megatrends is estimated to be USD 90-100 billion by the year 2020 and the industry has the potential to achieve revenues of USD 50 billion by the year 2020. If the industry can achieve this vision, then by the year 2020, there will be a dramatically altered industry with more diversified customer base, broad range of services, globalised talent pool and a portfolio of multiple co-existing business models. It will also achieve a transformational impact on the Indian economy and society .Global megatrends Implications for India Macro-economic India’s share of global GDP is likely to rise from 2.1% in 2008 to 3.3% in 2020 Per capita income of Indians has doubled over last 10 yearsl l Social and Environmental Teledensity increased 12-fold over the last 10 years from less than 2% in 1998 to around 24% by Dec 2007; likely to increase to 62% by 2013 Internet connectivity is also likely to increase with availability of spectrum for 3G and WiMaxl l Business and Technology Increased use of technology and BPO outsourcing in Indian companies Emergence of innovative business and service delivery models (e.g., SaaS, cloud computing) Increased investment in technology and BPO by central and state governmentsl l l Source: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Opportunity Assessment 233. industry outlook cuRREnT MaRkET SiZE The Indian IT-BPO industry (excluding hardware) is estimated to be a USD 63 billion industry by March 2010 employing over 2.2 million people and contributing to over 4 percent of India’ s GDP . On the back of the global economic recession, the growth rate for the industry for FY 2010 is estimated to decline to a low of 7 percent. The past year has witnessed a depressed demand environment with budget cuts and delayed decision making. However recent data indicates that the impact of the recession is bottoming out, decision making is starting to happen and there will be pent up demand for IT-BPO services which companies emerging out of recession will need to leverage to compete effectively . inDuSTR y STRucTuRE The industry has a healthy mix of Indian providers and foreign providers, with the latter contributing to 30 per cent of total revenues. Companies operate through a range of sourcing models- 1. Captive - An internal cost center or a 100% subsidiary company set up to execute IT -BPO services 2. Strategic Alliances/Joint Ventures - provider owned/joint operations transferable to the customer or provider at certain milestones/timelines 3. Outsourced/Third party - Use of a third party service provider to provide IT -BPO services iT-BPo EXPoRTS MaRkET The export industry is diversified across three major focus segments – IT Services, BPO and engineering services. While IT Services have been the mainstay of the industry, BPO and engineering services sector has built upon the India value proposition and today there exist integrated service providers across the three focus areas as well as niche providers. iT-BPo DoMESTic MaRkET The domestic IT-BPO segment is estimated to aggregate revenues of INR 650-670 Billion in FY10, as Indian firms increase IT adoption across verticals. The Government is expected to contribute significantly to this growth with budget allocation of US$10 billion over the next 3 years for the National e-governance Plan (NeGP). Leading Indian firms, multinationals as well as the SMEs are gearing their products and services to tap into the e-governance opportunity.USD Bn FY2008 FY2009 FY 2010 E Exports 40.4 46.3 49Domestic 11.7 12.4 14Total 52.1 58.7 63 Source: NASSCOM INDUSTRY STRUCTURE Share (FY2008) Indian Providers 65-70 per cent Foreign Captives 15-20 per cent Foreign Providers 10-15 per cent SERVICE LINES FY2008 FY2009 FY 2010 EIT Services 23.1 26.5 28 BPO 10.9 12.7 13.5 Software products/ engineering 6.4 7.1 7.5 Total 40.4 46.3 49 SERVICE LINES (INR Bn) FY2008 FY2009 FY 2010 E IT Services 318 381 434 BPO 64 87 111 Software products/ engineering88 101 114 Total 470 569 660 24DESCRIPTION FY2009 FY2014 FY2020 Export Revenues (USD Bn) 43.6 82 175 Domestic Revenues (USD Bn) 12.4 23 50 Direct Employment Generation (Mn Nos) 2.2 3.9 10 Indirect Employment Generation (Mn Nos) 8 12 20 Office Space (Sq. ft.) 220 420 1 Bn Direct Capital Investment* (USD Bn) 15-16 28-29 60-62 * Estimated assuming an industry average capital: revenue ratio of 1:5; and a lead of 3 years in the investment cycleMedium to long Term outlook Given the backdrop of large untapped demand potential and strong fundamentals, India is uniquely positioned to secure global leadership, grow its IT-BPO exports at an annual rate greater than 13 percent, and generate export revenues of USD 82 billion, and domestic revenues of USD 23 billion by 2014. Direct employment generation is expected to increase by 75% from FY09 levels, to 3.9 million, while indirect employment is expected to touch 12 million by 2014. Similar growth rate for the industry will propel the Indian IT-BPO exports market revenues to USD 175 billion by 2020, while domestic revenues is expected to grow to USD 50 billion in the same period. Direct employment is expected to reach 10 million, while indirect jobs are expected to total 20 million. Industry revenue growth can be further accelerated through deep and enduring innovation by industry participants, and focused initiatives by stakeholders to generate an additional US$125-135 billion in export revenue by 2020. Achieving these growth aspirations will entail a significant demand not only for human capital, but also significant infrastructure and financial capital in the country. USD 175 billion in IT-BPO exports by 2020 translates to office infrastructure of 1 billion sq.ft, and direct capital investment of approximately USD 60-62 billion. The following table illustrates the input requirements driven by the projected growth of Indian IT-BPO sector during the period 2009-2020. The Indian technology and BPO industry has contributed significantly to the Indian economy and society and can sustain and exceed this impact by 2020. Its contribution to Indian GDP can reach almost 10 per cent if the industry achieves its full potential. Further, it can create 30 million jobs by 2020, both in urban as well as rural and non-metro regions of the country. The industry can also foster India’s development by encouraging improved infrastructure and providing technology enabled basic services far more effectively and efficiently than today’ s traditional models.Software and Services Sector 254. key constraints and challenges While India continues to be the dominant player in the global sourcing sector, its future will depend on how challenges to its continued competitiveness are tackled. The primary sources of risk are low employability, infrastructure constraints, rising costs, security concerns, discontinuation of fiscal incentives and a supportive policy framework and lack of an innovation ecosystem. In addition, the competition is intensifying and many countries are now positioning themselves as global sourcing destinations providing a plethora of incentives.

Policy actions Required The following sections outline the policy actions required to address the concerns and challenges raised in the previous section. 5.1 MiTiga Ting ThE iMP acT oF ThE DownTuRn The global economic recession has created an uncertain demand environment, one where there is reduced spending on IT and BPO, but at the same time companies need to invest for the future into building competencies, expanding into new markets and focussing on innovation. Countries around the world have substantially invested in stimulus packages to support industry sectors and generate employment. The Indian government has also been supportive of the IT-BPO sector and has extended the tax incentives under Section 10A / 10B of the income tax act till March 2011. The following recommendations if implemented immediately can help the industry mitigate the impact of the downturn and contribute to India’s economic and social development. Fiscal incentives: Extend the tax holiday under Section 10A/10B of the Income Tax Act to provide parity with the SEZ scheme. This is particularly required for the SME sector and tier 2/3 cities in the country, wherein the SEZ scheme will not be viable. The SME sector in India accounts for over 6000 companies but contribute to less than 10 percent of the industry revenues. Companies in India need an enabling fiscal regime, as they face issues of enhanced competition from other countries. The extension also needs to be done for a definite period ahead, as extension by a year, while useful, does not help to promote investment. The government also needs to correct the anomaly in Section 10AA of the SEZ Act with retrospective effect. Fa st track domestic spending: The National e-governance plan has allocated investments that need to be made into key mission mode projects in the centre and state. It is critical that the government can fast- track implementation of all approved e-governance projects. This will help achieve the twin objective of enabling faster access to citizen services in the country as well as allow the industry to use its workforce for these projects. address issues related to protectionism: As unemployment has increased in the US and UK, many bills are being introduced in these countries that can possibly impact India’s business. These relate to specific changes in the US H-1B and L-1 laws and immigration policy in the UK. It is imperative that the government at the highest level raise these issues and help address them. Transparent and stable policy framework with defined implementation: In the last two years, India is increasingly being perceived as a difficult place to do business. While other competing countries are enhancing incentives and creating a pull for attracting investment, India’s changing or different interpretations to tax laws, labour laws, state laws is leading to a push away from India. It is imperative that a harmonious policy structure is created which is implemented uniformly across the country in a defined time-frame. Expedite structur al reforms in human resource development: It is important that while the focus on primary education and `education for all’ is implemented, the government address the issue of structural reforms in higher education that relate to accreditation system, faculty salaries, curriculum changes. i nclusive growth – help to develop a PPP framework: The industry in India is keen to partner with the government to enhance inclusive growth in the country. A well defined PPP framework across education, healthcare, financial services and public services will enable the industry to develop the content, applications and process frameworks so that access for all is enabled. 5.2 REaliSing ThE MEDiuM To long-TERM ViSion The industry has the potential to reach revenues of USD 105 billion by 2014 and USD 225 billion by 2020. While the industry will need to expand into new markets and build new competencies, it will not be demand constrained. The l l l l l lSoftware and Services Sector 27constraints on the supply side will need to be urgently addressed and a well defined implementation plan is needed with clear milestones. 5.2.1. improving the Supply and capacity of Suitable Talent India’s large talent pool is one of the key reasons for India emerging as a premier global sourcing destination. The demographic changes over the next quarter century will lead to evolution along fundamentally different directions for some countries. Some developing countries (e.g., India) will see an increase in their working age population (from 63 per cent in 2008 to 67 per cent in 2020) driven by relatively high birth rates and average life expectancy ratios. On the other hand, many developed countries (e.g., Japan, Germany, Italy) will see a declining working age population by 2020 driven by lower birth rates (8 births per 1,000 persons in Japan versus 23 in India) and higher life expectancy (82 years in Japan versus 69 in India). Even China will have a decline in the working age population (72 per cent in 2008 to 70 per cent in 2020). Hence by 2020, India will have the largest working age population in the world and therefore has the potential to have the largest pool of skilled workers in the world. However, with current levels of quality and scale in education, this tremendous opportunity could be lost. The government should make it a priority to significantly improve the quality and scale of primary and tertiary education in the country . Though India accounts for over 28% of the total suitable talent pool available to work in the IT-BPO sector across all the potential global sourcing low-cost locations, the proportion of graduates found suitable for employment is fairly low (quoted estimates range 10-20 percent). As a result the effective pool of employable graduates is far lower than the overall pool of people entering the working-age population. Currently, any graduate who is hired, irrespective of the institute he comes from or his skill levels, is put through the 16-week training (in areas such as technical skills, soft skills, company orientation and process-specific domain skills) when he joins the firm. It has been estimated that the industry spends a minimum of USD 1bn annually on this entry-level training. Recruiting a trainable pool is not a sustainable option going forward. Inadequate English-language proficiency and lack of soft-skills are the key gaps in the current graduate pool, reported by the industry . Policy Action – Talent supply 1. Introduce soft-skills program across universities in the country in partnership with the private sector. 2. Requisite skills and competencies w .r.t. all levels of employment in IT and BPO space to be mapped. 3. A credit based system for inter-operability between verticals and horizontal and vertical mobility to be introduced. 4. National standard on employability assessment. Given the varying standard of different institutes, a common nation-wide benchmark for assessing students is necessary. The inclusion of industry needs in this assessment will make it useful for recruitment. It will also ensure that colleges or training institutes include these specific elements in their curriculum. NASSCOM in partnership with the industry has created an assessment program – NAC for the BPO sector and NAC Tech for the` IT sector. These assessment programs need to be adopted as a national employability assessment across the universities in the country. 5.2.2 Structurally Strengthen the Education System The prevailing system of education in India is constrained by several factors. These include a lack of adequate capacity and number of institutions acknowledged as sources of world-class talent; poor systems of accountability and lack of pressure to perform; operational inflexibilities, bureaucratic controls and complex governance structures shared between the centre and the state; teaching/academics not considered an attractive career option, leading to constraints on faculty resources; key stakeholders (i.e. the education system and the industry) operating in silos, with limited mutual interaction/participation. The supply of graduates in India is growing at around 5 per cent a year. With a current average employability rate of 26 per cent for engineering graduates and 10 to 15 per cent for other graduates and declining willingness to work in Policy Actions Required 28the industry (from the current 80 per cent to 60 per cent in 2020 for IT and engineering graduates and 65 per cent to 45 per cent in 2020 for other graduates), the industry will face a talent shortage of over 2 million people by 2020 (1.5 million to retain current global sourcing market share, 0.8 million shortage in domestic market). The innovation market may lead to further demand of up to 1.2 million people including 300,000 PhDs. The government and the industry will have to take short-term and long-term initiatives to address the gap so that the industry is able to realise its full potential. The Eleventh Plan allocation of around USD 6 billion (Rs 19,282 crore) for higher education is very low compared with the anticipated requirement of over USD 55 billion (Rs 212,900 crore). One way to bridge the gap would be to encourage greater private participation in higher education. The government should address this situation by removing regulatory restrictions on private investment and provide incenti ves to encourage investment. Policy Action – Strengthening the Education system 1. Under Graduate and Post Graduate programs to be ‘Credit’ based and standardized nationally. In addition allow policy for introducing electives and add-on programs (employment oriented) in colleges affiliated to universities to be less constrained and to be executed in a shorter period of time by all BOS (Board of Studies). 2. Implement recommendations made by the National Knowledge Commission on changes in the governance structure in universities. 3. The Government has drawn up plans to establish 20 new IIITs and 8 new IITs. These need to be implemented with world class faculty and in partnership with the private sector. 4. Address gap of 1,500 universities by upgrading top-performing colleges to affiliating universities and/or by establishing Greenfield universities. 5. New technologies of pedagogy, such as ICT, broadcasting, etc. must be introduced to provide wider access to high quality education, to overcome the shortage of teachers and to increase capacity. 6. All non-formal education courses/programs including apprenticeships programs, to be standardized across the country for inter-operability; from the non-formal to the formal stream and from the unorganized to the organized sectors. 5.2.3 national Faculty Development Program 1. The Technical Education Quality Improvement programme (TEQIP), a Rs. 1550 crore World Bank funded initiative, is aimed at improving the quality of technical education in the country. TEQIP will address the major issues of selected institutes, like modernisation of laboratories and workshops, faculty and staff development, curricula improvements, course flexibility, interaction with industries, research, development of management capacity and networking of institutions for resource sharing. TEQIP-II type program to be made available to all 2000 engineering colleges 2. National Faculty Development program in consultation with the industry, both for Engineering and non Engineering colleges, for the short, medium and long term to be deployed 5.2.4 indian Student Fund aid agency Encourage students and working professionals to pursue further education for skill enhancement by providing tax incentives. Set up a student financial aid agency (such as the Federal Student Aid in the US) for demand-based funding of tertiary education. The central government can set up the Indian Student Aid Agency (ISAA) on the lines of the FSA in US. This agency should be responsible for disbursing needs-based funding to students in the form of grants, loans and work-study (earn-while-you-learn) programmes. The dual objective of this scheme should be to ensure that no student is denied access to education because of weaker economic background and that enrolment in higher education reaches 40 to 50 per cent by 2020. 5.2.5 Building Domain specialisation Further, as highly skilled talent enters the workforce, the gestation period before new employees can generate revenues (up to six months for some players) will diminish and there will be a much greater focus on ongoing development of Software and Services Sector 29specialised skills and capabilities. Career paths will become specialised, not only by domain expertise, but also by role (e.g., solution architect versus client advisor versus programme manager). While some of the initiatives targeted at building capability in students and faculty, upgrading curriculum, our long term objectives should be aimed at building skilled resources—Ph.Ds, and engineering graduates while sustaining and scaling the short- and medium-term initiatives. 5.3 BuilDing woRlD claSS BuSinESS anD Social inFRaSTRucTuRE Currently more than 90 percent of the industry revenues are from 7 cities in the country (Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, Kolkata and the NCR region). The infrastructure in these cities is heavily constrained – be it power, road, transport, residential accommodation and water supply. If the industry has to achieve the vision set up in the medium to long-term, there is a need to urgently address the infrastructure deficit in the country . In addition, the imperative to focus on balanced regional growth will mean that locations apart from these 7 cities should account for at least 40 percent of the industry revenues by 2020 and the current hubs will need to increase by at least 2.5 times their current size. Taking into account the above facts, we will have to promote the creation of integrated physical and social infrastructure in 10-15 Tier-II and Tier-III cities (including new township development) with high potential to serve as hubs for the industry (i.e., provide basic infrastructure, social facilities). Real-estate requirements by 2020 are estimated to be between 2,000 – 3,000 million square feet. The growth in population will require additional power and water supply, bandwidth, public transport and international air connectivity. Power and telecom needs alone will be as follows: Power: Additional power of 4,000 – 6,000 MW for office and residential purposes will be required. Most cities today have a power shortage of 5 to 10 per cent in the peak season. This gap can be addressed through captive power plants in offices and by electricity generation through nuclear and wind energy . Telecom: There is a reasonably high supply of telecom landline and mobile connections in Tier-II cities. The supply and quality of high-speed bandwidth, which is the backbone of technology and BPO companies, will need to be improved. Increased bandwidth requirement will be 250,000 – 400,000 mbps Pushing infrastructure development and developing new townships will call for a high level of collaboration between various stakeholders including the state and central governments and the private sector. A special nodal agency will be needed to coordinate efforts. Such an agency should be created in all states, responsible for driving infrastructure improvement in identified cities or new townships. Action will need to be taken across various fronts including: master plan development, model financial arrangements, land acquisition and auction, proper re-settlement of displaced persons, aviation and transportation planning, and educational linkages. 5.4 EnSuRing a Fa VouRaBlE BuSinESS Policy anD REgula ToRy EnViRonMEnT A favourable business policy and a regulatory environment are critical for the success of any sector. The Indian Government’s proactive approach towards the IT-BPO industry over the past decade is showcased in initiatives such as l lPolicy Action – Domain Specialisation 1. Launch and scale up technology and BPO specialisations across all vocational training institutes (Industry Training Institutes/Industry Training Centres). Industry would continue to provide vertical specific training and can carry out strategic acquisitions to facilitate that. 2. Domain specialisation needs to be built in research and education institutions; servicing the domestic demand would also lead to building specilaisation. 3. Increase number of PhD holders per million population by at least 5 times.Policy Actions Required 30the IT Act Amendment, tax incentives, telecom sector deregulation etc. The role of the private sector in developing the industry and providing it world-class facilities and services is also commendable. However, in the past year there have been concerns on the ambiguous and lack of consistent policy implementation in the country. Along with the sustained thrust from competing countries to attract investment through a plethora of incentives, there is an urgent need to address the policy environment from the perspective of investment, implementation and communication. Key policy changes wherein support is needed are: 5.4.1 Extend ta x benefits under Section 10A/10B and provide parity with SEZ scheme The tax incentives under Section 10A/10B of the Income Tax Act have enabled a policy framework wherein new businesses in the country have been able to reinvest their profits and build for the future. The companies have invested in world class facilities, extensive talent development initiatives, disaster recovery and power back-ups, transportation many of which are costs that companies in other countries do not incur . With the economic downturn, small and medium companies are facing issues of clients closing down, delay in payments, inability to garner working capital requirement. At the same time they need to invest more in sales and development, domain specialisation and IP development. Continuation of tax incentives will enable this sector to redeploy their profits and manage the downturn. Also, the conditions under the SEZ scheme are not conducive to the small and medium companies. The parity with SEZ incentives is needed both for building a vibrant SME sector and tier 2/3 cities in the country where SEZs are unlikely to come up. 5.4.2 Ensure implications of the Direct Tax code to be introduced in 2011 are not counter-pro- ductive and meets its key objectives While the draft direct tax code proposes reduced tax rates for all taxpayers, it also proposes to remove most of the tax incentives that are available. The effective tax rate for companies is reported to be 22.24%. With tax incentives withdrawn, the ETR of corporates below the average would tend to increase to 25%. The IT and BPO sector (in short “IT services”) has an unprecedented and commendable track record of earning precious foreign exchange for India and generating employment, which continue to remain vital for India, given its balance of trade and its demography. India’s exports in 2008-09 were USD 168 billion and the export of IT services accounted for an impressive USD 50 billion. India, with its talent and competitiveness, has earned the distinction of being the most preferred destination for outsourcing IT services. Being a knowledge-based services sector, more than 50% of the costs incurred are by way of salaries paid to employees and payments for outsourced services, which has features of full tax remitted through withholding and payment of taxes by individuals at rates significantly higher than average rate. In any tax policy, these rank as the most preferred features as they ensure complete economy in collection and minimum tax gap. The method of granting Foreign Tax Credit also needs to be addressed in the Code. Further, India has not, till date, entered into treaties with developed nations like the USA and UK for elimination of dual social security levies and as a direct consequence, provision of IT services, which requires significant deployment of on-site resources, entails incurring a significant social security taxes without securing any benefit. In these circumstances, the tax incentives granted to IT-BPO services should not be viewed as a revenue loss or tax foregone considering that the sector incurs many taxes for which credit is not granted by India and it contributes incrementally to the revenue by way of withholding taxes. Further, the new draft tax code proposes a MAT based on gross value of assets. Any tax on capital formation for productive purposes would be regressive irrespective of the positive the effect it will have in mobilizing tax revenues in the near term. The MAT proposed in the Code has a cascading effect, which makes the MAT levy inefficient. For new entrepreneurs with a vision of competing with established players, it is a tax on inflation, which in itself is an economic burden. It would be more regressive if there is no MAT credit that could be carried forward and set-off against normal tax in the future years as it would add to the aggregate tax on income. The current profit based MAT is Software and Services Sector 31equitable in as much as it is imposed only on profitable companies and thereby meets the test of the “ability to pay” whereas a MAT based on value of gross assets would be tax on the “ability to earn”. 5.4.3 Enabling environment – review of indirect and personal taxation; other relevant laws Strengthening the overall policy framework is another key aspect of policy reform required to strengthen India’s IT-BPO sector. This is essential not only for strengthening India’s value proposition as a safe destination to do business, but also to encourage the growth of the industry.Policy Action – Direct Taxes 1. Extend tax incentives Section 10A/10B and provide parity with SEZ scheme. Ensure these incentives can continue after the direct tax code is introduced. 2. Address the anomaly of Section 100 AA exemption with retrospective effect. The provisions of section 10AA of the ITA on the computation methodology should be introduced in the same form retrospectively in the Code. 3. Computation of MA T should be restored to profit based taxation. 4. The new draft tax code aims to improve the efficiency and equity of our tax system by eliminating distortions in the tax structure, introduce moderate levels of taxation and expand the tax base. However many of the clauses are creating anomalies and ambiguities and it needs a comprehensive review and addressal by the government. 5.5 gloBal TRaDE DEVEloPMEnT anD acTiVEly aDVoca Ting FREE TRaDE in SERVicES Expansion of the global IT-BPO market opportunity is directly influenced by the policy and regulatory frameworks governing cross-border trade in services. Growth of cross-border trade in services is constrained not only by tariff barriers – but more so by non-tariff barriers (e.g. national treatment in cross-border supply and movement of people). India must continue to work proactively with its trading partners (through the WTO and other trade promotion agencies) to streamline trade in professional services. India must push for the free movement of professionals engaged in delivering services on the basis of formal contracts, through a global GATS or professional services visa. It should counter protectionism by enhancing bilateral and multilateral agreements. It can pave the way for entry into the global market by proactively entering into agreements with governments in core and emerging markets to increase trade in services and the free movement of labour. At the same time, it must engage in bilateral or plurilateral negotiations on this with countries of specific interest to us. Negotiations are also needed to conclude agreements relating to exemption or refund of social security taxes paid by Indian professionals working abroad. The medium to long-term vision of the industry envisages that 80 percent of the growth opportunities will come from the non-core markets today, If India has to capture this opportunity, it requires a fundamentally different business model and initiatives both from the government and the industry.Policy Action – Indirect taxes; other relevant laws 1. Union Budget for 2009-10 included provisions for creating a safe harbour regime for defining taxation for multinational companies operating in India. This needs to be implemented on a fast track basis to enable MNCs to enhance their investment in India. 2. Strengthen “offset policy norms” to include technology and BPO and leverage defence/nuclear and infrastructure spending. 3. Resolve duplicity of indirect taxes for packaged software. 4. Policies to address delays in refund of service tax. 5. Creating a regulatory environment that is relevant from a service economy point of view. The current labour laws were drawn up at a time when India was mostly an agriculture/manufacturing based economy (e.g., not allowing women to work at night, maintaining tax returns in hard copies) with large part of labour within that sector. In the services sector, specially knowledge economy, the category of employees is different and hence nature of protection needed to be provided also needs to reflect the reality .Policy Actions Required 32Increased government support in trade development programs for this sector can play an important role in expanding the market for India. Today many companies, especially SMEs are constrained in their marketing efforts to lack of funds and the size/base to drive their messages in new markets and geographies. Policy Action – Global Trade Development 1. India must push for the free movement of professionals engaged in delivering services on the basis of formal contracts, through a professional services visa. Countries such as UK, Germany, France, Japan, already offer such visas and EU is working on short term work visa to cover entire EU territory. 2. Need to counter protectionism on sustained basis through effective negotiation with key countries. 3. Enhance bilateral and multilateral agreements (GATS) to encourage favourable immigration norms. 4. Negotiate Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty and Totalisation Treaties for a conducive tax framework. 5. Integrated communication and media campaign to promote India as a value added partner for IT-BPO services and products. 6. Ease visa norms for India and ensure that the process of getting a work visa for India is transparent and efficient. 7. Market Development Access of the government to build special thrust on emerging markets and SMEs to participate in global events. 8. Build alliances with key countries to develop language programs that can be offered as electives in colleges or specialised courses. 9. Partner with industry in building research and market access information in emerging markets. 5.6 FoSTERing a SuST ainaBlE EcoSySTEM FoR innoV aTion anD R&D Innovation will be a key requirement for success in the future. India has the potential to emerge as a leading hub of innovation in low-cost technology and process reinvention. To realise this potential, the government and the industry can undertake several actions to transform the eco-system and create enablers of innovation. In the medium term, the government should focus on enhancing and enforcing IPR laws to match the best in the world. India already has strong IPR laws; they need stronger enforcement to encourage companies to commercialise in-house developed technologies and processes. In 2008, the World Economic Forum ranked India 48 out of 60 countries in IPR protection. Further the government should catalyse investment in R&D to match the best in the world. Current spending on R&D in India amounts to 0.85 per cent of GDP , lower than in China (1.44 per cent) and Russia (1.77 per cent). A comparison of the number of researchers per million people across countries shows that India is lagging behind. The number of patents granted in India per million people is also lower than that in other emerging economies such as China, Brazil and Russia. A review of successful innovation hubs or ecosystems across the globe (such as Silicon Valley, Ireland and Israel) shows that five enablers are required for sustained growth of an ecosystem. Source: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Software and Services Sector 33The focus on developing an ecosystem of R&D and innovation will supplement the industry’s efforts to move up the value chain in terms of business model evolution and services provided. In addition to developmental research, it is also necessary to build capabilities in new/emerging areas that are likely to grow in importance over the next few decades. At least three such opportunities have been prioritised: 1) climate change and energy efficiency solutions; 2) mobile software applications; and 3) end-to-end clinical research. India has a head-start in these areas due to existing infrastructure (e.g., clinical research) or market maturity (e.g., mobile market), or because they are sunrise areas with no clear market leaders (e.g., climate change). The government can improve the innovation ecosystem by focusing on the following actions: Policy Action – Encouraging Innovation & R&D 1. 150% weighted tax exemption on in-house R&D expenditure in the Services (particularly IT) sectors. 2. The draft Innovation law proposed by Ministry of Science, Technology and Earth Sciences should be thoroughly examined by the DIT from an ICT perspective. The focus should be on the various collaborative R&D scenarios on IP ownership and revenue sharing models and using best practices, should arrive at a set of prescribed models that will be followed for each scenario. e.g for Industry-academia collaboration, industry-government collaboration etc. 3. Thematic Innovation Clusters specifically for developing new and innovative solutions for mobile applications, healthcare, climate change solutions, integrated design and manufacturing hubs for automotives. Identify 3-4 cities as emerging innovation hubs and build an integrated plan to develop and promote these. 4. International Collaboration on R&D - Enter into bi-partite agreements with foreign Government institutions to ensure that international research can be customised to an Indian content. 5. Government, in consultation with Industry and Government bodies should put in place a mechanism to ensure the rapid commercialization of (non-strategic) technologies developed in Government labs. This mechanism should ensure that companies, specifically SMEs which are developing similar/complementary technology are identified and collaborative work is facilitated. 6. Investment in innovation infrastructure - There is a huge requirement for Measurement, Standardization, Testing and Quality centres across the country. This infrastructure requires substantial capital investment which is difficult for SMEs in particular, and sometimes even the large companies to bear. The government should create and collate these with premier education colleagues and allow industry to use on a pay-per-use basis. 7. Encourage PPPs for R&D in sectors that have little private sector presence, such as defence, space and atomic energy. 8. The government must create a fund to provide grants to SMEs for global patenting and copyrights. This is an expensive process, and many SMEs do not have the funds to file global patents, thus losing their rights on the intellectual property created by them. With rising energy costs, and a renewed consciousness towards the environment, Green IT has emerged as a strategic shift for the entire industry. As IT infrastructure across the world increases, more equipment translates to higher power consumption and space, hence if products keep consuming energy at previous levels this will have serious implications on nature. The Indian industry has responded with a set of initiatives that aim to reduce its carbon footprint, and make it more profitable at the same time. Policy Action – Green IT 1. Standardization - There is a need for interoperable open standards for all the devices including networking equipments which is a prerogative of BEE and DIT. Need to standardize IT equipments and also set up benchmarks for Data centers is required. 2. Govt. Procurement - Government agencies should include the standards for energy consumption as the technical standards in government purchases. And with establishment of mutually agreeable standards between BEE and IT industry it should be made mandatory in all the government purchases. 3. Setting up Centre of excellence - Government of India should set up COEs (centre of excellence) in the top technical institutions and Universities. These centers can become the testing grounds and prototype/pilot evaluation stages for the Green (Clean) technologies. 4. T ax Incentives - Investing in the clean technology is a costly affair when the organisation is an early mover/ adopter. Tax incentives on the production of cleaner technologies and also for the user of the same are needed for better adoption. Policy Actions Required 345.7 EST aBliShing inDia aS a TRuSTED SouRcing huB FoR PRoFESSional SERVicES - Managing RiSkS EFFEcTiVEly The Indian IT BPO industry is involved in mission critical applications for its customers and is part of a globally integrated value chain. Expansion to various delivery centers across geographies, complexity of work being outsourced, strong linkages to business outcome and tighter SLAs, compliance to complex regulatory frameworks of the home and the host country, data security and asset protection at each delivery center are some of the key reasons for the industry’s focus on managing its’ risks. The increased concern on terrorism, geo-political risks and the already large footprint of multinational companies in India, is increasingly raising concern on the risk profile of India and what steps are being taken to mitigate these risks. Government and the industry need to reinforce India’s reputation in the world markets and start positioning India as a “trusted sourcing destination”. Policy Action – India as a trusted sourcing destination 1. Develop a national security strategy and design a security organisation on lines of the US Homeland Security with appropriate systems. 2. Facilitate speedy investigation and prosecution for IP thefts, cyber crime. 3. Facilitate the development of common data centres by institutions such as STPI so that small companies can build data recovery centres at shared costs. 4. Increase capacity and upgrade skills of law enforcement agencies in India to proactively prevent, manage and investigate threats to national security. 5. Help address perceptions about `India risk’ by putting together suitable communication (eg Incredible India campaign) and helping it to reach the right stakeholder. 5.8 ca TalySing gRowTh in ThE DoMESTic MaRkET The domestic technology and BPO industry in India is at an inflection point today. As India rapidly grows into one of the largest economies of the world, this will not only lead to the rise of personal consumption in the Indian middle class but also fuel the growth of several, large and global Fortune 500 companies of Indian origin. The increasing affluence of the Indian consumer and globalisation of Indian corporations will likely lead to increasing sophistication of domestic demand in product complexity, delivery flexibility and service levels. These trends will have significant impact in growing the size and scope of the domestic addressable market. As Indian consumers and corporations rapidly adopt mobile phones, and Internet access and broadband connectivity expand, there is likely to be a significant increase in spend on IT hardware, software and services. Finally, the biggest domestic opportunity in most sectors (e.g., banking, insurance, retail, telecom and healthcare) lies in tapping the opportunity to serve the billions of underserved at the bottom of the pyramid. India is likely to be the laboratory for disruptive innovations to serve these underserved segments at a price and performance profile that suits these conditions. Contrary to popular perception, Indian enterprises have significant legacy assets and have systematically invested in technology over the last 10 years. Two of the largest sectors, BFSI and telecom, which together contribute close to 50 per cent of the total addressable market, have already reached significant technology spend levels. For example, BFSI companies already spend 6.5 per cent of their revenue on IT , which is not far behind developed country benchmarks (e.g., US IT spend as a percentage of revenue in BFSI is 7.6 per cent). The central and state governments have succeeded in the adoption of IT in several departments (e.g., Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Income Tax, Land Registry). These initial successes have created significant momentum for adoption of IT and IT-enabled public services across several departments (e.g., Healthcare, Education, Public Distribution Services, Unique Citizen ID). While the government has very well planned projects under the National E-Governance Program (NeGP), there are a number of issues that impede fast track progress on these projects. The tendering process is elongated and not Software and Services Sector 35conducive to needs of small players. In addition, there is no clear roadmap on outcomes and process specifications keep changing. Also, the coordination between central and state governments is limited – same project being executed differently in different states. Policy Action – Domestic Market u 150% tax exemption on R&D for the manufacturing sector to be extended to Investments by that sector in IT adoption. This incentive could be extended primarily to the SMEs and for adoption of green initiatives facilitated by technology adoption. u Program office under PMO to review and monitor e-governance. Clear directive to centre/states on implementation.

Focus on definite end points, delivery timelines and actual, demonstrable performance. Government should disburse funds in the form of a loan; once desired timelines and targets are achieved, it can be converted into a grant (e.g., restructured Accelerated Power Development Reforms Programme (R-APDRP)). u Focus on standardisation - encourage development of centralized frameworks, templates, architectures and if needed, applications; Build evaluation committees which has the competence and domain expertise and does not need replication in each department. u Allow reusability of solution that is developed in one state in another state. u Empanel the right size players for specific initiatives – large size for strategic initiatives and small size for others.

If India’s GDP continues to grow at 7 per cent a year, in 2020 the number of citizens in the high-income segment will rise to 52 million and in the middle-income segment to 372 million. The number of households in the low-income group will drop to 933 million. As a result, India has the potential to add around 4 million citizens every year to the high-income segment and 26 million citizens ever year to the middle-income segment up to 2020. ICT-enabled solutions in healthcare, educa-tion, financial servic-es and public services can drive socioeco-nomic inclusion of 30 million citizens each year, faster, cheaper and more effective-ly than traditional models. To achieve growth, India needs to address demand supply gaps in four key areas.Policy Actions Required 36ICT-enabled solutions can overcome the difficulties that hamper traditional solutions. Analysis suggests that less than 10 per cent of demand for outpatient visits in rural India requires face to-face interaction with a doctor. More than 90 per cent could be addressed through a combination of trained paramedics and ICT-enabled remote sessions. ICT can enable a hub and spoke model to meet the needs of rural healthcare. The chart above depicts a hub-and-spoke model for healthcare. It consists of an integrated hub in major urban centres housing a pool of qualified doctors, a central electronic health repository and an ICT enabled mission control centre to track and monitor delivery of services through its various spokes. The spokes include a portfolio of services that help bridge the gap between urban and rural availability of infrastructure, skills and healthcare services. ICT-enabled solutions that enable remote access to remote doctors through electronic diagnostic devices and real-time video conferencing can offer not only access to quality advice but at a much lower cost to the patient (USD 1.1-1.31 per 5 minute consultation). Traditional models in banking are based on business components that are not effective or efficient in addressing the needs of rural or low-income segments. Examples of a few business components with associated challenges include: Bank branches or ATMs: Too expensive to operate in sparsely populated areas Credit risk management systems: Not valid in data scarcity environmentsCentralised lending operations: Not possible in a low automation environmentManagement Information Systems (MIS) for transparency and accountability: Expensive investments required by small companies operating in rural and low income segments. A lack of automation also makes it difficult to implement the required MIS. l lllSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Software and Services Sector 37ICT enabled solutions can overcome challenges faced by traditional solutions in financial services Source: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020 India has made significant progress in education with respect to access and enrolment in the past decade, largely driven by the government flagship programme in elementary education - the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). The number of schools increased by 40 per cent between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007, approximately 98 per cent of habitations have access to a primary school and 86 per cent have access to an upper primary school. The net enrolment ratio (NER) at the primary level stood at 92.75 per cent in 2006-2007 compared to 84.5 per cent in 2005-2006. Approximately 1.5 million teachers have been added to the system between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007 Nevertheless, five challenges remain in education in India: performance, teacher capacity, teacher quality, administration and private participation. ICT-enabled solutions can address four of the five challenges mentioned on the previous page: Pe rformance: Standardised online performance assessment of students will help in monitoring and assessing the performance of students. Graded questions of progressively increasing complexity and a focus on understanding and analytical thinking rather than on memorising facts can be created centrally and administered at rural school level. Teacher capacity: Virtual classroom settings in which a teacher delivers online coaching to students in an individual or group setting can help increase teacher capacity. Students can be given access to CDs containing recorded lectures by faculty. Quality: Teacher training by a master teacher through interactive and instructor-led methodology will help increase the quality of teachers. The quality of content can be improved by providing interactive, multimedia- based content. Administration: An effective MIS can help improve school administration. Also, information availability at the country level will help in planning access to education for all.l ll lPolicy Actions Required 38ICT can overcome challenges faced by traditional models Policy Action – Inclusive and Equitable Growth Offering ICT solutions for Inclusive growth 1. Set up a nodal agency with the mandate to strengthen and implement ICT solutions in key sectors. Partner with the private sector to implement these solutions. 2. Lead and catalyse the development of a legal framework for remote healthcare and consultation and electronic health records. 3. Create a national information structure in partnership with the industry and NASSCOM (e.g., the UID initiative is a first step in this direction). Providing connectivity and access4. Continue to provide incentives for broadband rollout (e.g., USOF*); establish stricter norms for rollout with defined timelines. 5. Develop a policy framework focused on public access (e. g., inexpensive rural broadband access) 6. Educationa. Empower 1.72 mn schools and colleges with broadband in urban and rural areas and ensure there is at least 1 PC per 40 students. This will enable 326 mn students to access broadband by 2014. b. Provide each of the 7 mn government school teachers with a laptop and broadband connection as it will enable them to access quality content and also perform administrative duties much faster. c. Incorporate broadband aided education as part of the course curriculum. d. Encourage PPP initiatives to ensure timely maintenance of PCs/broadband connections. e. Empower teachers via professional development training programs to enable them to impart education more effectively.India has already experienced multiple ICT-enabled solutions across all the four areas, most of which have been successful in the geographies in which they are implemented. Unfortunately, very few of these solutions have been scaled up to the national level. Mobile and broadband and Internet connectivity are critical to increasing the reach of ICT-enabled solutions. Mobile connectivity will allow the rural population to access call centres and use telemedicine, mobile banking and public services. Broadband and Internet connectivity will enable kiosk-based delivery of healthcare, education and public services.Source: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020 Contd..Software and Services Sector 397. Healthcare a. Empower 50,000 PHCs and 6,000 CHCs with broadband to enable them to provide better medical facilities. b. Empower all CSCs, PHCs and CHCs with telemedicine facilities to ensure high quality healthcare facilities at reduced costs in remote areas. c. Provide high-speed broadband connection to all rural telemedicine centers to enable doctors to access patient data (x-ray, ultrasound, etc) on real time basis. d. Provide all doctors and paramedics associated with PHCs and CHCs with a laptop and broadband connection. e. Automate all processes of PHCs and CHCs so that information technology (facilitated by laptop and broadband connection) can be used to increase the efficiency of the system e.g. via template based data entry for patients records, vaccine supply chain system that maintains the expiry date/batch numbers of the drugs supplied and a simple system that can be used to request for drugs, etc. 8. Innovative pricing models, such as prepaid broadband (on the lines of prepaid mobile) should be introduced to increase demand of broadband and a subsequent reduction in prices. 9. Promote more franchisee based models such as internet kiosks and ePCOs. 10. Tax rebate should be provided to consumers for buying computer (say, up to Rs. 50,000/- in a block of 3 years) and for Internet & broadband access up to a sum of Rs. 1000/- per month. 11. Service tax on broadband to be reduced from the current 10.3% to 5% by 2014. 12. Easy availability for educational loans to students and employees for purchase of low cost devices including netbooks etc. Improving hard and soft infrastructure 13. Provide incentives for developing low-cost computing platforms that facilitate technology adoption in rural areas. 14. Assign the mandate and funding to build hard as well as soft infrastructure (the NII) to an existing body (such as NISG) or to a new government entity. 15. Revise policies to accelerate soft infrastructure development, focusing on: 1) overall IT literacy; 3) interoperable application standards. 16. Catalyse incorporation of basic IT literacy programmes in all primary and secondary schools in collaboration with state governments. 17. Encourage computer based educational programmes and training for teachers (by the State Boards and SCERTs). 18. Provide incentives to MSMEs in the form of tax holiday on PC rentals, 100% depreciation on all IT investments and free broadband trials for 3 months. This initiative would require an investment of Rs 8 billion by GoI. 19. Cyber cafes should be promoted as multipurpose centre points with additional facilities such as telephony, ticketing etc. The wide range of services offered would increase footfalls and with higher ARPU, the owner could give the user a discount on broadband access. 20. Encourage PPP initiatives required to provide subsidized PCs and broadband connection. 21. 256 kbps connectivity seems inadequate for CSCs to operate, at least a 2 Mbps connectivity would make it feasible for the CSCs to roll out wide ranging services, from education, healthcare to providing Government services. 22. CSCs to be set up in all 600,000 villages. (Of Rs.15 billion meant for subsidizing CSC operations, Rs. 10 billion is yet to be spent – this could be utilized immediately to add more CSCs).Policy Actions Required 40appendix 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 CAGR 2008-2012 Worldwide Services 688,134 708,679 740,821 781,279 828,956 4.7% Worldwide Software 294,746 308,268 326,021 348,811 375,907 6.2%Total 982,880 1,016,947 1,066,842 1,130,090 1,204,863 5.2%Worldwide Spending on Software and Related Services ( USD million) Source: IDCSoftware and Services Sector 41glossary BPo BPO includes processes that may be IT-enabled, do not necessitate on-shore presence and are hence, offshore-able.

Executive summary BackgRounD Electronics, reported at USD 1.75 trillion, is the largest and fastest growing manufacturing industry in the world. It is expected to reach USD 2 trillion by 2014 and USD 2.4 trillion by 2020. Currently, the demand in the Indian market stands at USD 45 billion and is projected to grow to USD 125 billion by 2014 and USD 400 billion by 2020. Further, exports are expected to increase from the current USD 4 billion to USD 15 billion by 2014 and USD 80 billion by 2020. (Please refer to table in Appendix.) Domestic consumption is expected to grow exponentially at a CAGR of 22% for the period 2009–2020. This will be driven by a surge in income levels, the aspirational value of electronics goods, demand from a resurgent corporate sector and the government’s focus on e-governance. Domestic production is at present less than 45% of domestic consumption. There is a huge gap in the demand and supply which will widen as the demand grows and domestic manufacturing continues to slacken. Significantly most of India’s electronics imports are from China, Indian government may like to reckon this from a strategic perspective. challEngES anD oPPoRTuniTy As we realize that electronics industry in India is at cusp of a large and growing opportunity, we need to be mindful that there have been some missed opportunities in past decade. So while future holds a lot of promise, their still exist multiple challenges that can shackle growth of the industry such as inadequate infrastructure, tax structure, supply chain and logistics, inflexible labor laws, limited R&D focus, funding, limited focus to value addition and exports. Supply is not keeping pace with demand in India, which has resulted in ever-increasing imports into the country from China and Taiwan. Local manufacturers cannot match the competitive prices of imported finished goods due to the challenges mentioned above. In terms of opportunities, the electronics industry can significantly boost India’s GDP , generate employment, modernize processes and enable country’s inclusive growth. Domestic manufacturing companies can expand the production to USD 100 billion by 2014 and USD 400 billion by 2020 with a very significant contribution to GDP , at 20% for 2020, at par with other economies. The electronics industry can increase employment in the country significantly, since some of its segments, such as electronic system manufacturing, are human capital- intensive. The industry employs around 4.4 million people currently and this number is expected to grow to 16.1 million in 2014 and 27.8 million in 2020. The electronics industry has a high potential for domestic value addition, especially in some of its segments, e.g., semiconductor design and electronics system/product design. Electronics can facilitate e-governance, developmental schemes and initiatives launched by the government, e.g., Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA), Restructured-Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme (R-APDRP) and Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGREGA). The government’s allocation of funds for developmental schemes and initiatives is close to USD 45 billion. However, IT intervention is required to ensure the effective implementation of these schemes and initiatives. The government is in the process of setting up Common Service Centers (CSC) at the village level, increasing tele- density, scaling up broadband access and power availability. These initiatives aim to modernize and transform India, enable equitable and inclusive growth and make ICT relevant for everyone in the country. We may have to go many steps in that direction to a connected country with access to all, by introducing schemes such as School-school mein computer yojna, Gaon-gaon mein computer yojna and Ghar-ghar mien computer yojna , which l l l l l 48need to be implemented to achieve this. Although these schemes require heavy investment, they offer huge opportunities for the manufacturing and design industries to create designs for products manufactured in India. The government’s long-term vision should focus on enhancing the role of technology in key verticals, as listed below, to augment initiatives in these areas.l REcoMMEnDa TionS The Government of India would do well to foster a globally competitive industry . The industry needs to focus on the following: Increased value addition Implementation of best practices Catering to the needs of domestic and global markets by creating innovative product designs and R&DDriving cost competitiveness The government can catalyze this growth by the following measures: l lllVision 2020 Information access to allEnergy Healthcare Education Digitization Security india needs to follow the example of countries such as France, where access to the internet is a right rather than a service. The internet opens up vast avenues ranging from basic information, education and access to public services. connectivity should therefore be integral to the indian government’s vision for 2020. 1 Promote existing clusters and create new onesEstablish ‘National Electronics Mission’ Rationalization of tax structure65 Creation of a manufacturing value addition fund 4Creation of a R&D fund3“Made for India” Goods2 7Promote skill development Government needs to focus on skill development, regulations around over-time and contracts need to be flexed.Establish ‘National Electronics Mission’ – a nodal agency for the electronics industry within DIT and with direct interface to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The nodal agency will help in the synchronized functioning of the industry. It will enhance the ease of doing business. Stable tax structure needs to be put in place in order to encourage long term investment by the companies.A separate fund may also be created to provide interest linked subsidy to promote value added manufacturing and create products for India.A fund may be created to incentivize R&D, where the government and the industry bodies are stake holders.Encourage products specifically designed for India. Developmental sector can benefit from biometric readers, smart meters, micro payment devices, and low cost devices.Create islands of excellence by encouraging and planning for the expansion of existing centers such as Sriprembudur, Noida, etc. and identify more locations to set up clusters to create a complete ecosystem where all the segments of the value chain are available at one location. Provide contiguous land and Infrastructure to the industry to these clusters.Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 49Certain procedural intervention measures will also be imperative: Recommendation 1: Monitoring and auditing mechanism for government funded initiatives. Recommendation 2: Make the recipients of government funds accountable for efficient and timely utilization of the funds by making them time-bound. Recommendation 3: Initiate a multi slab investment program, linked to manufacturing value addition, through a Special Purpose Vehicle for the electronics industry. The various segments of the electronics industry need to be given an impetus. Each segment of the electronics ecosystem varies in the extent of value addition it requires, its contribution to the economy and its future growth potential. These factors have been elaborated on in the matrix below:l l l It is essential to have in place the right policies and regulatory environment to drive sustainable growth across the segments and create full-fledged electronic systems and a design and manufacturing ecosystem in India. We have shared a more detailed perspective of industry-wide recommendations in this report and have also elaborated on recommendations that are specific to each of the industry segments in the following chapters.Industry segmentValue addition indexEmployability indexContribution to GDPSize of industry (USD billion)Growth potential Semiconductor designH LM ->H (Long term)9.0 Very high High-tech manufacturing M MM -> H (Long term) 0.6 Long-term impact Electronic componentsL M L 2.1 Very high EMS/Assembly L H L 1.0 Medium Electronic systems designH M H 27.9 Very high L: Low, M: Medium, H: High way FoR waRD Thanks to the fast pace of technology evolution, industry again has an opportunity to leapfrog some of the earlier technologies and be globally competitive. This will require a strong push to rapidly develop the electronics ecosystem and for the industry to develop a strategy. Impetus needs to be given to the small and medium enterprises (SME) as they drive the growth in this industry . As China and Taiwan are way ahead in competition, India’s focus may be on value addition. Abundant talent pool and resources could be utilized to produce high-value products, hence domestic value addition may be encouraged and incentivized. Further, tomorrow’s markets are expected to emerge in the Middle East, Africa and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). India is uniquely positioned geographically to export to these markets as well as Europe vis-à-vis China. Establishing business relations in Africa is easier due the Africa’s openness towards India.‘Electronics industry’ entails electronic systems design and manufacturing which comprises semiconductor design, high-tech manufacturing, electronic components, EMS, and electronic systems design for consumer electronic products, telecom products and equipments, and iT systems and hardware. The industry may be designated as a strategic industry having a nodal agency within DiT and with direct interface to the PMo.Executive summary 50It will also be imperative to identify unique Indian needs and for both the manufacturing and design industry to create a designed for India, manufactured in India product strategy which can also open doors for export to large markets in developing economies with needs and demographics akin to India. Both the industry and government need to look at this opportunity with a sense of urgency, as it can transform the face of the nation (in the same way software has achieved in some IT hubs) and propel the nation and industry players to another high growth trajectory, generate employment and augment India’s branding as a technology powerhouse. India today can ill afford to miss this immense opportunity in this strategic industry and lose ground to other competitive countries.Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 51Size of the global electronics industry vis-à-vis other major industries 4.40 times oil, petrol and minerals 2.75 times chemical and plastics2.45 times food, beverages and tobacco2.44 times transportation2.20 times electricity, gas and water2. need for domestic manufacturing MaRkET PoTEnTial: ThE DEManD FoR ElEcTRonicS global electronics industry The global electronics industry is estimated at USD 1.75 trillion for 2009. It accounts for 2.9% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of USD 60 trillion. During the 2004–2009 period, the global industry has grown at an annual rate of 3%.

Export of electronics stood at USD 4.4 billion for FY09, representing 21% of domestic production. Exports have grown at 19.5% annually for the FY04–09 period. gRowTh DRiVERS oF ThE inDian ElEcTRonicS EcoSySTEM The key drivers of the domestic market: Driver 1: growth in per capita income and corporate spend on electronics The growth in per capita income has been the major trend driving this market. Nearly 10 million households are es- timated to have income levels above USD 10,000 per annum. With a annual growth rate of 20%, this segment offers significant opportunities for electronics products. Transformation of electronics goods from an aspiration to a utilitar-ian need has made these products more affordable for people. Further, the quick rate of obsolescence in technology is bringing down the prices of products and making them affordable for lower income groups as well. Driver 2: g overnment focus on infrastructure The Indian government is keeping to its promises and its objective to achieve inclusive growth for all sections of so- ciety and realizes the critical role of education, rural employment and power sector reforms in the socio economic development of the country. These three sectors lay the foundation for the development of human capital and indus-trial growth. The government has launched a number of programs to augment growth in these sectors. The government has also brought in major policy changes by passing the Right to Primary Education Bill to give a boost to the education sector. After the success of SSA in achieving substantial enrolment in schools, the government now aims to provide free access to secondary education in the country. Government initiatives such as MGREGA aim to increase livelihood and job opportunities. Driver 3: i ncreasing spend on iT equipment IT and ITES industries continue to drive the demand for the IT equipment. With public and private sector firms in India adopting automation, the demand for IT equipment is increasing. Government of India has announced National e-governance Plan for effective administration with an estimated budget of more than USD 9 billion for automating processes in most of the government departments. There are 27 mission mode and several important projects being undertaken. These would generate enough opportunity for the electronic industry to grow. Driver 4: n eed for innovative products at low cost India is a price-sensitive market and with unique socio-economic needs, it has a substantial demand for cost-effective and robust products. Products that meet basic requirements at penetration price points can create a market. A water purifier at a price point of less than USD 41, a mobile phone at a price less than USD 23, a car at a price less than USD 2,100, marketed by leading companies, have all met with a huge success.Need for domestic manufacturing Total domestic production of electronics 54Driver 5: intellectual property in india India should pave the way for encouraging conversion of its ‘intellect’ into actual ‘property’ by providing incentives to retain intellectual rights. This will not only mean more direct contribution to the country’s exchequer, but also create business opportunities and generate employment. Above all, such new opportunities can result in bridging the digital divide further. IP creation gives revenues that are at the least 10 times more than the ‘creation costs‘. Currently, India creates close to 90% of the value chain, yet, gets ‘credit’ for only about 10%. If the IP is ‘owned’ by India, then this entire revenue from the IP creation (i.e. 100%) is credited to India vs. the 10% in the current ‘service’ model. DEManD-SuPPly gaP The rapid growth in the demand for electronics, clubbed with the slow rate of increase in domestic production, has resulted in an increasing demand-supply gap in the industry. While the demand for electronics stood at USD 45 billion in FY09, goods worth USD 20 billion were produced in India. Demand supply-gap projected to increase further by 2020 Total demand The demand for electronics is expected to increase at 22% annually during the FY09–20 period to reach USD 400 billion. This includes domestic consumption and exports. Domestic production At the current growth rate of 16%, electronics production is expected to rise to USD 104 billion in FY20. This will result in a significant increase in the demand-supply gap, which will rise to USD 296 billion. Hence, it is essential to achieve a higher pace of growth. The targeted growth rate in the production of electronics is 31% annually for the FY09–20 period, to reach a value of USD 400 billion. While USD 80 billion worth of products are expected to be exported, it is projected that USD 320 will meet the domestic demand.Source: CEHA and FICCI Source: Industry estimates at the current pace, the demand-supply gap is projected to increase from uSD 25 billion in F y09 to uSD 298 billion in Fy20. RESul T: TRaDE iMBalancE The trade imbalance is projected to increase to uSD 323 billion by 2020. Domestic production is unable to fulfill the demand in the market. This is fueling imports, thereby increasing the outflow of foreign exchange. The projected increase in the trade imbalance, based on the industry’s current rate of growth, is demonstrated in the following figure.Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem Demand-supply gap in electronics hardware industry: FY09 (100%=USD 45 billion) Projected demand-supply gap in electronics industry (USD billion) 55import of electronics is expected to increase to 16% of india’s gDP. EnaBling Policy anD REgula ToRy EnViRonMEnT in coMPETiTiVE counTRiES chinese SEZ model China initiated its liberalization process with the formation of SEZs in the early 1980s, as compared to India, which commenced planning and setting up SEZs in 2005. Four of China’s five SEZs are strategically located near ports and trading countries such as Hong Kong and Taiwan.The country decentralized power by authorizing local provinces to frame the requisite guidelines to administer the different zones. Benefits to business units differ across SEZs and are based on various parameters such as length of operations, use of advanced technologies, volume of export generated and others. Malaysian growth story The Malaysian economy, which was based on primary commodities such as tin, rubber and palm oil, has been transformed into a dynamic industrialized market. Further, the country’s electronic industry has witnessed phenomenal growth in terms of its manufacturing capabilities, employment opportunities and contribution to total exports. A variety of l lllNeed for domestic manufacturing 56factors, such as the country’s political and economic stability, investor-friendly policies, productive workforce as well as its robust infrastructure, have been responsible for this growth. Some of Malaysia’ s policies and initiatives: liber al equity policy: The government allows 100% foreign equity holding for investments in the new projects of companies or their investments for expansion/diversification of projects, irrespective of their level of exports. attr active tax incentives: The country’s corporate tax rate was reduced from 26% in 2008 to 25% in 2009. The government also offers other significant tax incentives such as a pioneer status, investment tax allowance, reinvestment allowance, incentives for high technology industries, as well as others for manufacturing projects under the Promotion of Investments Act 1986 and the Income Tax Act 1967. Vietnam: Emerging manufacturing destination During the past 10 years, Vietnam has consistently witnessed high economic growth, which, coupled with political stability in the country, has been the key driver to attract foreign investors. Factors such as strong work ethics, improved infrastructure, reduced labor costs and the availability of a skilled labor pool have also been instrumental in making Vietnam an attractive destination for Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS), semiconductors and Original Device Manufacturing (ODM). Another key factor that has attracted foreign direct investment in Vietnam is the country’s “China plus one” model, wherein companies are opting for Vietnam to reduce their dependence on China and evenly spread their business risks in Asia. l l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 573. challenges faced by domestic manufacturers According to a recent survey conducted by a US MNC, infrastructure and taxation issues are the two main factors inhibiting foreign investments in the Indian electronics ecosystem. The major factors that require immediate attention are detailed below: The prime challenges that need to be addressed to drive growth in the Indian electronics ecosystem include: challenge 1: inadequate infrastructure interrupting growth The three elements of infrastructure posing significant challenges to Indian manufacturers are: Power: Power drives the manufacturing industry. India has a rising demand and not sufficient supply. There are leakages at the distribution level which result in losses. Transportation: Lack of adequate infrastructure is affecting the attractiveness of India as a manufacturing destination. The country’s infrastructure is in a poor condition vis-à-vis China. The gap between the two countries is widening every year with China investing 20% of its GDP in infrastructure as compared with India’s 6%. land: Acquiring land to set up manufacturing facilities is a time consuming process in India. Further, there have been instances of significant delays. These infrastructural challenges make doing business in India difficult. challenge 2: Tax issues When compared to low cost destinations such as China and Taiwan, India’s current tax structure makes the final product less competitive. Tax structure prevalent in the country encourages low cost imports which have retarded the growth of the local manufacturing industry. Stability of taxation is another issue. Companies cannot plan a long-term investment in the country as the tax structure/policies keep changing. challenge 3: limited preferential market access for local companies As of now there are no preferential laws or incentives in place which enforce usage of domestic products to some extent. This results in excessive import of low cost products leaving no means of revenue generation for the local companies. Challenge 4: Non-availability of finance at competitive cost Small and medium industry is a growing segment and a key driver of growth for electronics manufacturing. This segment needs proper financing at competitive cost which is currently not available, hindering growth of the industry . l l l l llChanges necessary to attract investment 58challenge 5: Supply chain and logistical hindrances In the current scenario, India has a poor component manufacturing base. Components are imported from countries such as China, Taiwan and Korea. In India, poor logistics infrastructure complicates the supply chain. The inability of domestic manufacturers to accurately predict the receipt of raw materials mandates high inventory levels to ensure uninterrupted production. This adds to the cost of production and the declining competitiveness of domestic manufacturing units. challenge 6: limited R&D focus Competitors such as China and Taiwan are way ahead of India in the volumes game. The focus area should be adding more value to the existing products and creating new products through investment in R&D. Every company should be encouraged to invest in R&D through incentives for Intellectual P roperty Rights creation. Challenge 7: Inflexible labor laws Under the current labor laws, the ability of an organization to align employee strengths with demand cycles is curtailed. Flexibility in labor laws is essential to cater to rapid seasonal variation in demand. Regulations around over- time and contracts also makes it difficult to meet the highs and lows of demand. iMPacT on ManuF acTuRing oF ElEcTRonicS in inDia impact on costs and returns Manufacturing of electronics in India faces significant challenges. High transaction costs are the result of stringent rules and regulations, complex administrative processes and infrastructural deficiencies. An analysis by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) reveals that cost disabilities, including the transaction costs borne by Indian exporters, vary and range from 19–22%. In contrast, exporters in developed economies pay only 2–3% of transactional costs. The following table illustrates the net impact of these issues on a electronics manufacturer in India vis-à-vis one in China for a 50% value-added product with an assumed sales price of INR100: India China Remarks Sales (-CST @ 2%) 100 - 2 = 98 100The 2% Central Sales Tax (CST) translates to a selling price of INR98.

Recommendations to drive growth in indian electronic systems, design and manufacturing ecosystem goVERnMEnT MuST PRoViDE iMPETuS FoR DoMESTic ManuF acTuRing In order to drive high growth in the industry, it is imperative for the government to provide impetus to the domestic manufacturing industry. Following recommendations are aimed at the government to help create the necessary push: Recommendation 1: Establish a ‘national Electronics Mission’ Establish a nodal agency for the electronics industry within DIT and with direct interface to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The nodal agency may have the following functions: Build and promote “Brand India” Attract investments to IndiaFacilitate doing business in IndiaR&D fund managementManufacturing value addition fund management The National Electronics Missions may be structured on lines of the National Solar Mission. In order to attract investments, the nodal agency shall take India’s value proposition – a world class infrastructure and rising domestic demand – to the world. The nodal agency shall carry out the functions as that of the Foreign Investment Implementation Authority (FIIA) specific to electronics sectors. This single nodal agency shall also facilitate vertical coordination between the centre and the states as-well-as horizontal coordination amongst the various concerned ministries. case study: national Solar Mission objective: to make India a global leader in solar energy and envisages an installed solar generation capacity of 20,000 MW by 2020, of 1,00,000 MW by 2030 and of 2,00,000 MW by 2050 implementation: Financial division n Create and manage funds n Oversee capital subsidy funding through banks Technology & tariff division n Monitor global and domestic technology development n Define tariff levelsl llll l l 62Special projects n Execute utility and rooftop demonstrating projects n Set up solar generation plant infrastructure Research and Development n Set-up a research council n Set-up a centre of excellence for solar energy n Involve academic institutions Human Resource and development n Involve academic institutions n Introduce a government Fellowship programme Recommendation 2: Promote existing clusters and create new ones India has created a world class manufacturing ecosystem in Sriperumbudur, which is a testimony of India’s capability as a low cost manufacturing country. It is essential to take this success forward and set up world class infrastructure. Further, the government may identify more locations to set up clusters and replicate the success of Sriperumbudur. This will bring in synergies, save costs and improve competitiveness. States should be encouraged to create electronics manufacturing clusters provided they satisfy certain basic minimum ‘hygiene factors’ to enable creation of end-to- end value chain with up-stream and down-stream industries in close proximity . These are:l l l State Nodal Agency for single window clearance and inter-departmental co-ordination. Ready infrastructure, easy access to port/air-port and State-of-the-art logistics for fast track clearance and quick turn-around. Making available land, power and other amenities within state control at concessional rates Easy access to Financial Institutions and Commercial bankl l l lCreate access to talent - Infrastructure for skilled manpower, Technical/Vocational training institutions Infrastructure for collaborative R&D and TestingInstitutional framework for market development – National and InternationalSoft-Infrastructure and amenities for employees – quality housing, health-care, education facilities, restaurants, entertainment avenues etc.l l l l case study: Sriperumbudur, Tamil nadu In 1996, Hyundai Motor India became the first MNC to set up a manufacturing facility at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu. The MNC was followed by 50 ancillary manufacturing units, which turned the area into an auto manufacturing hub. The South Korean auto major has invested USD 888 million in India. In 2001, Saint-Gobain, the France-based glass manufacturer, followed with a USD 118 million facility, also at Sriperumbudur, and subsequently invested another USD 177 million in the project. In 2005, Nokia set up a cell phone-manufacturing facility in its SEZ at Sriperumbudur. After this, a host of smaller companies followed suit, setting up their own manufacturing facilities in the area. The key factor that enabled the tremendous growth in this region is its enabling bureaucracy, which expedites the processes of land acquisition and other procedures. Further, the state’s single-window clearance scheme facilitates setting up of manufacturing facilities at Sriperumbudur. The availability of skilled manpower adds to the attractiveness of this cluster. Recommendation 3: Provide preferential market access to local companies Encourage the production of “Made in India” goods by reserving a particular share in the market for Indian products. MNCs are also setting up design centers that specifically cater to the Indian market. Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 63This can be achieved in the following manner: Recommended 30% of the demand must be met by products made in India if they are technically and commercially competitive for government procurements. Using products made in India to execute national projects such as national knowledge network, rural broadband and Common Service Centers (CSC). Specifying 30% value addition for foreign investment in a specific technology if products made in India do not exist in a specific technology area. Using products made in India as part of bi-lateral trade and providing trade-in grants in the form of the products. Recommendation 4: create R&D fund for the industry An R&D fund may created where the government and the industry bodies are stake holders. This may be used to incentivize research and innovation leading to growth of the industry . Recommendation 5: create manufacturing value addition fund for the industry To enable the industry access funds at internationally competitive rates, a manufacturing value addition fund (in the form of interest subsidy fund) may be created to promote domestic value addition. The fund may be used to provide financial assistance in the following manner: Provision of interest subsidy linked to value addition. Provision of interest subsidy linked to increasing the local content of Bill of Material (BOM). Recommendation 6: Rationalize tax structure Stable tax structure needs to be put in place in order to encourage long term Investment by companies. Favourable taxation rates extended under the recent fiscal incentive package should be continued and prevail long-term to make available products at affordable prices. The introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is expected to bring rationality and transparency to the tax structure. However, challenges of Octroi, Surcharge and Entry tax need to be eliminated. Recommendation 7: Promote skill development It is estimated that around 16.1 million people will be directly employed in the industry by 2014 and 27.8 million by 2020, as compared to the current 4.4 million. According to the report on Manpower for electronics industry, the concentration of manpower is in the manufacturing segment followed by after sales and sales support. R&D on the other hand employs the least number of people. Regulations relating to over-time and contracts also need to be revamped to meet the highs and lows of demand. Hence, the government needs to focus proactively on skill development. The recent report on ‘Human Resource and Skill Requirements in Electronics and IT Hardware’ by the National Skill Development Mission may be referred to in this regards. Recommendation 8: Sustainable growth and development – green electronics & e-waste Management To ensure sustainable growth and development of the electronics industry in India, standards for the energy efficiency for electronics products in harmonization with international standards need to be developed urgently for the Indian market. Suitable incentives will need to be offered to encourage companies to adopt such standards. Further, the issue of e-waste management needs immediate attention. The government should announce a dedicated legislation for the management of e-waste, mandating all stakeholders in the electronics value chain to execute their responsibilities and liabilities with no adverse impact on the environment. Producers/manufacturers, through effective take-back l lll l l l l lRecommendations to drive growth in Indian electronic systems, design and manufacturing ecosystem 64programs, need to ensure that e-waste is recycled in an environmentally sound manner. Similarly, component manufacturers should ensure that the content of hazardous elements is minimized (R oHS). Recommendation 9: Demand consolidation to boost manufacturing IT based security systems are gaining importance for protection of buildings/campuses as well as surveillance and response capabilities. By designing an effective bulk procurement system for consolidated requirements, the consequent manufacturing capabilities in IT hardware and sensors would have beneficial effects in related IT , telecom and electronics fields. IT equipments like computers for school are required in very large numbers for schools. Similarly, with implementation of e-governance projects underway, there is a significant requirement of IT products by the States. Suitable bulk procurement could be designed, incorporating the conditions for domestic manufacturing, to meet such demand. There is a strong case to move away from incandescent technology for lighting to LED-based technology directly, bypassing CFL route, since disposal of CFLs has a significant adverse impact on the environment. Creating bulk procurement program as in case of the CFL lamps, manufacturing of the LED lighting would get a boost. Further, through a similar mode, the solar PV lanterns with LED bulbs for remote village lighting under the RGGY or MNRE Scheme can also boost value addition and manufacturing of LED in India. In the long-run, efforts need to be made to make silicon chip for the PV lanterns domestically by encouraging the domestic manufacturers so that the supply chain can be complete. All defense and homeland security procurement of IT/electronics equipment should be progressively opened up to the private sector which shall be encouraged for Value-addition/increasing local content as specified by the said agencies. This would provide fillip to local manufacturing. Procedural intervention measures Apart from the recommendations given earlier in this report, certain process improvements that may drive growth in domestic manufacturing include: Recommendation 1: Formulating and implementing a monitoring and auditing mechanism for government-funded initiatives: Implementation of e-governance projects should be tracked and their progress made public. Recommendation 2: Making the recipients of government funds accountable for their efficient and timely utilization by making such funds time-bound; enforcing penalties for non-achievement of pre-determined objectives, e.g., conversion of grants to loans, as in the case of APDRP . case Study: R-aPDRP – what was different? The key takeaway from R-APDRP is its execution strategy. The scheme has clear timeframes for execution and delivery. Funds are allocated in advance to the stakeholders of the policy. There are two parts to the scheme, and only if utility completes the first part, can it invest in the second. Moreover, in this policy, funding is directly related to the outcome within a definite period of time. If stipulated timelines are met, the government converts the loan into a grant. If the utility does not complete the project in the specified time, it has to pay back the loan. Further, the program tries to minimize the work required to be done on the field, e.g., preparing a shortlist of consultants, system integrators and project executors and chalks out a plan of action, which includes the list of products or applications that need to be used. l l l l l l ll l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem Contd.. 65 This scheme recognizes the importance of IT as a tool and lays emphasis on the use of technology as well as on funding. Most importantly , R-APDRP is the only scheme that gives incentives to people in the utility if they are able to meet loss-reduction targets. Recommendation 3: A multi-slab, multi-threshold incentive package such as the Special Incentive Package Scheme (SIPS) should be announced to attract electronics manufacturing Investments at various levels. This is to offset the disability costs suffered by the domestic manufacturers on account of infrastructure and other handicaps. Such a package can be administered through a through a Special Purpose Vehicle where the disbursement mechanism could be linked to the proportion of domestic value addition in each of the industry segments/verticals. The Special Purpose Vehicle could be created under the proposed ‘National Electronics Mission’ or the Department of IT . DRiVE cuST oMiZa Tion wiTh ‘MaDE FoR inDia’ PRoDucTSl l “Made for india” products Government can encourage the use of products made in India for developmental initiatives such as e-governance plan, UID, SSA and R-APDRP . Create standards for voltage, frequency and thermal variations as well as EMC/EMI and safety, which will reduce the imports of sub-standard products into the country. Encourage development and deployment of bilingual (english with one or more Indian languages) software in order to address the language barrier in local markets. All computing devices procured by the Government should be enabled with local language interface. Create and make available product specification for government initiatives in advance. This will provide the Indian manufacturers with the lead time to create products, align production and make the necessary investments. E.g. Digitisation of broadcasting infrastructure, UID, financial inclusion and others. With the growing trend of convergence, it is essential to promote a ‘internet with a device’. This initiative should ideally be funded through the USO fund. Government procurement with higher local value addition should be encouraged. REcoMMEnDa TionS To EncouRagE PRE-coMPETiTiVE RESEaRch Recommendation 1: Offer R&D grants to companies that generate product revenues from the country and have substantial local value addition done from within the country. Recommendation 2: To encourage innovation in the industry, permit 300% expenditure on R&D/New Product Development/Indigenization for deduction from taxable income. Currently this is pegged at 150%.Recommendation 3: Offer tax rebates for patent filing expenses to encourage companies to innovate and gain competitive edge in their respective areas of business. Recommendation 4: Set aside a seed fund of INR2,500 million (equivalent to USD 55 million) to support technology and innovation focused start-ups in products/technology space at their seed stage. Recommendation 5: Investors making investment in qualified product/technology start-up should be given a tax credit equal to 30% of the investment value.l ll l l l l llll‘uniquely indian products’ for ‘uniquely indian needs’ at ‘uniquely indian prices.’Recommendations to drive growth in Indian electronic systems, design and manufacturing ecosystem 66Recommendation 6: Set aside a fund of INR1,000 million (equivalent to USD 20 million) to provide multiplier grants for collaborative research programs between industry and academia in the areas related to semiconductors and electronics.

Currently, the country is not fully utilizing its talent and capabilities in manufacturing to address this increase in demand. As such, the government can set up manufacturing plants, generate employment, lower the existing level of imports and give impetus to the economy. Exports in the industry are expected to increase to USD 80 billion by FY20. Significant growth potential: Growth in the industry will boost the economy, as this industry works as a feeder industry for other industries. Enhanced production in this industry will lead to growth in several other industries where hardware/components are required. Employment opportunities: It is anticipated that the industry can potentially employ close to 27.8 million by 2020. Employment features as one of the most important priorities on the government’s agenda. This industry is labor-intensive and can employ a large number of people with standard educational qualifications. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs): The SME segment is the key growth driver of the manufacturing industry. However, the sector is cost-sensitive, and if low-cost imports from other countries are not minimized, it is likely to face challenges. nation’ s strategic and security interests: Electronics used in aerospace, defense and other parts of strategic establishments are mostly imported. This can pose threats of design leakage or any other intrusion, which may hamper the country’s security. Hence, such goods should be indigenized as far as possible.l l l l lindia is expected to create employment opportunities for up to 27.8 million people and demand valued at uSD 400 billion in 2020. 687. key industry segments SEgMEnT -wiSE PRojEcTionS Segment-wise projections of the electronics industry: Target (USD billion) 2014 2020 Semiconductor design 20.0 58.2 High-tech manufacturing 4.0 22.6 Electronic components 2.6 3.4 Electronic Manufacturing Services 1.4 2.3 Electronic systems IT systems and hardware 16.7 54.4 Telecom products and equipments 29.5 153.5 Consumer electronics 8.1 17.8 Others (Industrial, Automotive and others) 2.7 7.8 Exports 15.0 80.0 Total of all segments 100.0 400.0 Source: EY AnalysisElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 69SEMiconDucT oR DESign anD high-TEch ManuF acTuRing Semiconductor design: VlSi design, embedded software and reference board design overview The semiconductor design industry primarily comprises three segments — embedded software, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design and reference board design. Embedded software development contributes more than 80% of the segment’s revenues and has an equivalent proportion of employees. VLSI design contributes approximately 13% to overall revenues and 11% to the overall workforce. Hardware board design constitutes the remaining 7% of total revenue. The present and the future The potential of the Indian design market is expected to increase to USD 20 billion by FY14 and USD 58.2 billion by FY20. The total engineering headcount for VLSI, board design and embedded software is expected to increase to 219,000 by 2010. India is expected to continue as the preferred destination for embedded design and development. The focus on intellectual property (IP) development will increase as third-party design services companies look to move up the value chain. The localization of product design and manufacturing from India will drive significant investments. The industry is likely to continue facing significant challenges to manage demand and workforce churn. The industry will have to constantly evolve, upgrade and innovate while keeping the costs down to remain competitive in the global market. The proximity between third-party service providers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for end-to-end product design is also likely to increase. Trends Business models for design services are expected to shift from Time & Material and linear with people strength to risk-reward and non linear. The demand for local content in products sold in India is on a rise. India is being recognized as an design hub by foreign companies with operations in India Increasing business from mid-size and smaller companies are driving hardware designs to India.Consolidation demand will continue to evolve the dynamics of the semiconductor industry ecosystem.Impetus is being given to fabless product design and development initiatives in India The government’s role as a catalyst is important, as has been experienced in countries such as Japan, the US, Taiwan, South Korea and China. challenges challenge 1: c ompetition from other asian countries China has expanded its scope in recent times and has begun manufacturing as well as designing semiconductors. As such, China’s semiconductor industry has grown significantly in the past few years. The country is presently home to more than 400 fabless companies. Vietnam is also emerging as a competitor. challenge 2: incomplete ecosystem Most companies in India are either into integrated design, embedded software or VLSI design. This has led to an incomplete ecosystem from the perspective of a semiconductor products company. Several key links, such as systems engineering, venture capital and IP protection, are currently missing from the ecosystem. challenge 3: Shortage of design-aware manpower Another issue affecting the growth of the Indian semiconductor industry is the shortage of skilled manpower at all levels of engineering projects, especially in design services. The absence of institutions imparting technical training relevant t o this segment has further aggravated the situation.l l l lll l l lKey industry segments 70Recommendations Recommendation 1: Initiatives need to be undertaken to promote innovation in R&D and product design. Creation of local IP should be encouraged. Recommendation 2: National projects (national knowledge network, rural broadband and so forth) should be executed using Indian products. Recommendation 3: The government should encourage incubating Indian start-ups. The government may set up a focused venture fund of around USD 50 million to provide seed and start-up capital for new ventures to undertake R&D and product development. Recommendation 4: The government can subsidize acquisition of EDA tools by start-ups and other SMEs in this sector. Prototype development centres with adequate fabrication facilities can be set up. Include the entire revenue earned by fabless companies for benefits under STP and SEZ policies, as long as 90% of the design is done in India. Recommendation 5: Provide special tax incentive to entrepreneurs from within and outside India setting up design and development centres in India. Recommendation 6: Extension of EHTP/STP scheme till the year 2015. Recommendation 7: Creation of a fund to provide fiscal support to SMEs and MSMEs on a continual basis. high-TEch ManuF acTuRing Demystifying semiconductor-related high-tech manufacturing The semiconductor industry is pervasive in nature and is a key driver of the nation’s economy. Semiconductors represent the convergence of many devices, systems and technologies and are widely recognized as technology enablers for the entire electronics value chain. The pervasiveness of semiconductors in other fields has become pivotal in giving the industry a competitive edge. Semiconductor manufacturing extends beyond wafer fabs to include ATMPs (Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging facilities (ATMPs), solar photovoltaics, displays, optical LEDs, displays, display panels, storage devices and advanced micro and nanotechnology products. These products and other semiconductor devices are used in several applications, such as telecommunications for ubiquitous accessibility, in electronics and consumer applications for product quality (e.g. PCs, mobile phones and TV sets), and in the automotive industry for safety, energy saving and driver assistance. As such, it is important that the domestic manufacture of these products be incentivized to give impetus to the Indian electronics system design and manufacturing industry.l ll l l l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem Vision high-tech manufacturing relates to semiconductor-related manufacturing. This segment includes wafer fabs, aTMPs, solar PV manufacturing, storage devices, displays, display panels, lEDs and nano-technology products. Projected size of the segment: u SD 4 billion in 2014; 22.6 billion in 2020 The present and the future India has a large and growing market for electronic products, as the use of semiconductors in such products is on the rise. The following table illustrates the Total Market (TM) and Total Available Market (TAM) revenue trends for the segment: l l \u0018\u0018SegmentTM revenues (USD billion) IT/OA 2.5 Wireless handsets 1.7 Communications 0.8 Consumer 0.4 Industrial 0.1 Automotive 0.1 Others 0.3 Source: Aneesha Dhar, “Transfer pricing report,” EY CBK, June 2009, via IRADSource: “India Semiconductor Market – 2008,” ISA – Frost & Sullivan, January 2008 Indian semiconductor industry revenue trend Semiconductor fabs are capital-intensive and have a long gestation period. ATMPs, on the other hand, require much lower capex. Solar PV manufacturing offers yet another exciting opportunity – the use of solar panels, both for off-grid applications, especially, in the short to medium term, and for grid-connected power in the long term, augurs well for the growth of the domestic solar PV industry. Moreover, in line with energy conservation measures, LED manufacturing is also likely to be a high-potential area. In addition, the domestic manufacture of storage devices, displays, display panels and nanotechnology products should be encouraged. Production in the segment is projected to increase to USD 4 billion in 2014 and 22.6 billion in 2020. Policy and regulatory environment The Indian government’s announcement of a semiconductor policy is a laudable initiative. It can be considered a major step toward attracting foreign companies to set up manufacturing facilities in India. The policy covers wafer fabs and ecosystem units such as LCDs, storage devices, plasmas, photovoltaics, solar cells and nanotechnology products, and also includes the assembly and testing of such products. The government will bear 20% of the capex for units located inside special economic zones (SEZs) and 25% for units located outside SEZs. The government has proposed a minimum investment of USD 555 million for semiconductor manufacturing (wafer fabs) plants and USD 222 million for ecosystem units. State governments may provide additional incentives to the investors. However, these incentives have not been extended to older plants with second-hand equipment. The policy has attracted considerable interest from solar PV investors. However, in order to attract investments in wafer fabs and other ecosystem units, the following policy amendments have been proposed: amendments to the semiconductor policy Extension of the policy Due to the uncertainty in the economic environment, it is difficult to project the year of revival of the semiconductor industry. The experts opine that the present situation for the semiconductor industry would last for at least two years. As such, it is proposed that the deadline of March 2010 be extended to March 2015. The extension will provide time, as the slowdown has severely impacted the semiconductor industry, thus leading to piling: n To market the policy and improve India’s prospects of attracting investments n To highlight the importance of the domestic market to potential investors appraisal process n It is also suggested that the government takes faster decisions and makes early announcements of approvals of proposals in order to send positive signals to the other investors. l l l l l l lKey industry segments 72Suggestions for, and amendments to, the semiconductor policy lowering the threshold limit for aTMPs and other ecosystem units The threshold limit for certain categories of ecosystem units such as ATMPs, optical LEDs, storage devices, LCD, FPD, photovoltaics, fuel cells, micro- and nanotechnology products (as defined in the Special Incentive Package Scheme, or SIPS, needs to be re-visited, as these units may not require large investments of USD 500 million. Lower threshold limits of USD 100 million for the incentives available under the policy are expected to generate interest for such categories of ecosystem units that have not been seen so far. This lowered threshold limit needs to be defined in consultation with industry professionals. The above areas required for wafer fab, form an critical part in the high-tech manufacturing value chain. Manufacturing infrastructure located in high-tech areas of the country can also serve as a pull factor to set up wafer fabs. It may be mentioned that countries such as Vietnam, China, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia are well on their way. In addition, the government should identify and incentivize anchor investors in areas such as ATMP , storage, LCD and LED. Financial closure commitment The current policy requires investors to demonstrate the legally binding commitment of equity holders and debt financiers to provide or mobilize funding for achieving financial closure (at least 90% of the total project cost). Projects envisaging large-scale investments are implemented in phases. As the major markets for the products from fab and ecosystem units are presently targeted at exports, investors find it difficult to produce legal documentation for achieving financial closures of such magnitude from financial institutions at the time of submitting the proposal. Release of incentives The current policy provides for the release of the incentive being linked to the achievement of the threshold investment. It is proposed that the payment of the incentive to investors may be advanced, although the threshold investment may not have been reached as yet. The suggested measure would provide investors with funds at an early stage, which is crucial for the project’s timely implementation. components of project cost The policy is not clear with regard to the inclusion of costs on utilities, interest charges and so forth as part of the project cost. It is important that the total project cost of running the plant, including the items mentioned above, are considered for the award of the incentives. Recommendations to promote solar PV manufacturing Recommendation 1: Industry size and volume of production are key issues to address the economies of scale. Scale and integration should be encouraged through the provision of higher incentives, as they reduce manufacturing costs. Recommendation 2: The lack of adequate financial resources, particularly at attractive interest rates, is a key barrier for the industry. The availability of funds at a less expensive rate will go a long way in attracting a large number of players in this area. The government can float tax-saving renewable energy bonds such as infrastructure bonds to collect low-cost funds from the general public. Recommendation 3: It is well-recognized that R&D and innovation are one of the key drivers of development in the solar PV industry. Accordingly, the following initiatives are recommended to encourage R&D in this industry in India: n Collaborative research among government, R&D institutions and industry . n Coordination among various government departments doing R&D in this field. n Coordination among stakeholders, namely industries, research institutions under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and government departments such as Department of Science and Technology (DST)l l l l l l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 73competitive landscape: china and Taiwan China’s semiconductor market primarily consists of electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies, original design manufacturers (ODMs), and OEMs that consume chips in China. The Chinese semiconductor industry’s revenue in 2008 totaled USD 76.5 billion. This is expected to decline 5.8% to USD 72 billion in 2009. China is the largest IC market in the world, with a market scale at USD 85 billion in 2008. However , the market share of domestic suppliers was less than 7%. The ease of doing business between semiconductor companies in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan continues to grow.l llln Commercialization of developed technology. n Development of a proper framework for technology transfer and collaboration within India as well as globally to obtain the best available technology as well as provide direction to future R&D. n Development of high-end skills for R&D to overcome the scarcity of scientists a nd researchers in this area. Recommendation 4: Equity funds/Venture funds should be created to nurture solar PV start-ups and seed funds for solar PV research projects. Recommendation 5: A comprehensive national policy for solar energy in India based on the recommendations made should be formulated to achieve set objectives and goals at the national level and encourage the growth of this sunrise industry. It is recommended that the growth of the solar PV industry should be implemented under Mission mode. The semiconductor industry’s growth enablers IT/Office automation (ITOA), wireless handsets and communication are the top three contributors to the semiconductor total market and the mainstays of TAM revenue generation. The rollout of third-generation (3G) and WiMAX services can serve as the harbinger of associated infrastructure equipment. Other growth drivers include: growing demand from the domestic market: The Indian market is witnessing strong demand. Increased consumer spending on entertainment and the rise in demand for related lifestyle products due to changing consumer preferences are key growth drivers. growing i T industry: Growth in the IT industry is also driving the semiconductor industry. The IT segment is divided into IT systems and hardware and ITOA, which includes printers, notebooks, desktops, monitors, servers and copiers. IT/ITOA contributes 42% to TM and 46% to TAM in the semiconductor industry. Enabling policy environment: The government is making efforts to facilitate effective policy implementation. The semiconductor policy of 2007 received an encouraging response – 17 proposals received envisaging investment of USD 35 million. growing high-tech design industry: The high-tech design industry is a high-growth segment and is expected to reach approximately USD 20 billion and USD 58.2 billion by 2010 and 2020, respectively .l l l ll l Set-top boxes (STBs), wireless handsets, 3g rollouts, wiMaX, notebooks and smart cards are expected to primarily drive the indian semiconductor market.Key industry segments 74china: future stateElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem Source: “IDC: 2009 toughest year for China’s PC market,” ChinaDaily.com website, accessed 2 October 2009.

The period was marked by declining duties on finished electronic goods, which created an inverted duty structure. This spurred an increase in the import of finished goods, resulting in a steep decline in domestic production of electronic components. As a result, demand for electronic components declined significantly over the years. The International Trade Agreement (ITA) signed at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997 eliminated all customs duties on IT products, thereby creating an environment of direct competition between Indian component manufacturers and international players. Intensified competition weakened the cost competitiveness of Indian manufacturers, forcing many companies to exit the market. Over the years, the contribution of domestic manufacturing to domestic consumption has been declining. The following table reveals that domestic component manufacturing has not been able to keep pace with the growth in demand. 76Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem current State In FY09, the Indian electronic component market was valued at USD 2.1 billion, with an 11% share of the total electronics market. The electronic components segment supplies to the consumer electronics, telecom, defense and IT verticals. The various constituents of the electronic component segment are illustrated below: Passive components account for the largest revenue share of 23%. The key constituents include transformers, chokes and coils, capacitors and resistors. Electronic tubes have the second-largest revenue share of 21%. The key constituents include TV picture tubes, X-ray tubes and cathode ray tubes. Segment size: current and projected The production of electronic components declined by 13.3%, from USD 2.4 billion in FY08 to USD 2.1 billion in FY09. For the five-year period of FY04–09, the segment grew at a CAGR of 4.6%. Fluctuations in growth rates and a decline in production characterized this period.

Each year, around three million science and engineering graduates are added to the workforce, much higher than in China and other developed countries. The quality of Indian graduates is also ranked better than in China, Vietnam as well as Japan and the US on certain parameters. Rise in EMS: Currently, a number of OEMs are outsourcing their low-end product development, manufacturing and distribution to EMS companies to focus on the development of high-end products with higher margins, brand- building and marketing and sales strategies. As such, EMS companies have significant market potential. The EMS segment in India has the ability to capture 2.2% of the global EMS market, which is projected to reach USD 497 billion by 2010.

Significant e-goverance initiatives and developmental plans, such as the UID project and MGREGA scheme, are also increasing the demand for electronic components and devices. changing dynamics of the segment growing consumer class: India has a growing consumer class, which comprises people with an annual income of more than USD 10,000. The group is estimated to grow to more than 80% of the total population by FY10. This concurrently reflects on the available aggregate disposable income in the economy that may be channelized to increase sales of consumer products. lifestyle changes: With greater exposure to global trends, Indians now have an increased affinity for convenience and lifestyle products. This is encouraging the launch of higher-end consumer products in the market. challenges hampering growth of electronic components manufacturing challenge 1: a zero import duty regime is impacting competitiveness The zero-import duty structure encourages the import of finished electronic goods, leading to a decline in demand for electronic components. challenge 2: Rapid technological innovation mandates high capital investment T echnology changes rapidly in manufacturing sectors. In order to compete with low-cost destinations such as China and Taiwan, India needs to keep pace with the technological innovations. As a result, the capital required to set up and maintain a manufacturing facility has increased manifold. It is even more difficult for an SME in this segment, since capital investment is high but the return on investments is almost insignificant, at around 7–9%. challenge 3: inverted duty and taxation structure implies more tax When compared with China and Taiwan, India’s current duty and taxation structure makes the final product more expensive, as there is no duty on the import of electronic components. The inverted structure has resulted in higher tax rates for products with higher value addition. The table below denotes value addition at different stages of the electronics manufacturing value chain, quantifying the impact of disabilities on components:l l l l l l Therefore, value addition in the electronic components segment is second only to raw material, which results in a high-cost disability. \u0018\u0018Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem challenge 4: unavailability of raw material domestically Most of the raw material required for electronic component manufacturing is not available domestically. Hence, manufacturers need to import material from countries such as China, Taiwan and Korea. The low production volumes of Indian manufacturers inhibits them to negotiate competitive rates from these suppliers, which impacts the cost of production. Recommendations Recommendation 1: create hubs of excellence for component manufacturing: clusters Create pockets of excellence or clusters to promote the manufacture of electronic components in India. These clusters will create scale, provide R&D and testing facilities, develop skill as well as address infrastructure challenges. Noida and Chennai may be the pilot zones for setting up such clusters. This is because each has the following: n Large concentration of electronic component manufacturers n Presence of the buyer segments: assemblers and consumer electronics manufacturers Recommendation 2: Encourage collaboration with international players Rapid innovations in manufacturing technologies require significant capital investments. The collaboration of Indian manufacturers with international players is essential to provide access to technical knowledge and capital. Such collaboration will ensure higher standards of quality in manufacturing, leading to greater acceptability in the global market. Recommendation 3: Reduce the impact of transactional costs The impact on the cost-competitiveness of manufacturers due to significant transactional costs and the duty structure may be rationalized. Recommendation 4: Focus on R&D and value-added products Focus on R&D and develop of value-added products to distinguish India from other countries. There is a need to identify specific products where India’s cost competitiveness exists and encourage domestic manufacturing. l l l l l 79Key industry segments iT SySTEMS anD haRDwaRE The global IT systems and hardware spending is estimated to have grown at 4% from USD 570 billion in 2007 to USD 594 billion in 2008. North America and Asia each accounted for 28% of the market, while Western Europe accounted for 25% of the market in 2008. The IT systems and hardware industry in India is still looking to carve a niche in the global industry. This industry has immense potential for a multiplier effect on the economy; however, due to the lack of favorable government policies, the opportunity has largely eluded India. The government needs to create a conducive environment to foster demand in this segment, which in turn, can be leveraged for manufacturing investments. The recent demand-led-manufacturing success of the mobile handset industry in India is a good example. India has experienced phenomenal growth in PC sales. The number of PCs sold in India has increased to 6.7 million units in FY09 from 3.1 million units in FY04, translating into a CAGR of 17%. Segment size current and projected state India, at 17% CAGR in FY09, is one of the fastest-growing IT systems and hardware market in the Asia-Pacific region. Nearly all the prominent global vendors and some local, have a strong presence in the Indian market. Most MNCs have their assembly units in India. With PC sales of 6.8 million units in FY09, the PC penetration stood at 2.6%. Notebooks and Netbooks have caught the fancy of the consumers while growth of desktops has stagnated.

PC and server sales in India (million units)India hardware domestic revenues - 2008 (USD million) Source: “Manpower for electronics Industry,”MAIT, 2008 Source: Nasscom strategic review 2009 growth drivers highly competitive domestic market: With a significant presence of MNC vendors and local players, the latest technology offerings are available to Indian consumers. Further , unique to India, an unorganized sector , with a 30% market share, caters to some of the most price-sensitive as well as geographically remote segments of the market. Expanding e-governance and social programs: With the government expected to spend over USD 9 billion in e-governance, including the 27 mission-mode projects, IT consumption is expected to get a significant thrust. Further, the government has announced several other social programs with significant outlays for IT to monitor and deliver these programs and set up CSCs at every village. growth in telecom infrastructure: Increased access and broadband penetration is also expected to drive PC sales even in tier III cities and rural areas.l l l 80Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem Small and medium businesses (SMB) segment: The SMB market in India has remained largely untapped. SMBs in India are expected to invest approximately USD 4 billion on IT systems and hardware in FY10. Notebook PC- spending rose at 43% among Indian SMBs in FY07. awareness and affordability of technology: The increasing purchasing power of the Indian population has significantly boosted PC penetration in the country. increasing notebook sales: Notebook sales are expected to drive the growth of the PC market as domestic and global vendors seek to penetrate lower-income segments, smaller and medium businesses and newer regions. Taxation/Policy While IT systems and hardware enjoy low taxation currently, as compared to some of the other sectors, the taxation/ policy has not been conducive to the growth and development of this segment historically . The current taxation policy on IT systems and hardware: IT systems and hardware, covered under the IT Agreement of the WTO, does not attract any customs duty. However, a uniform 8% excise duty/CVD is levied. The current fiscal incentive of 8% must be maintained for the growth of the segment. This uniform excise rate across the entire IT value chain has mitigated the earlier challenge of unutilized CENVAT in the manufacturing of PCs due to higher excise rate on input components. A uniform 4% VAT is levied on IT products across all states in India. However, certain states deviate from this uniform rate or introduce taxes at their discretion, which is highly detrimental to the business. The introduction of GST is expected in April 2010. This will make the tax structure simple, rational and transparent and will resolve the longstanding segment issues of the refund of SAD and unfavorable abatement rates on import on certain specified IT goods. However, the challenges of local taxes such as Octroi and entry tax would continue to agonize the segment. The industry has been demanding that such taxes be abolished. Dynamics of the iT systems and hardware segment Shift from oEM to oDM: Brands are transitioning from being an OEM to an ODM. There is a shift from manufacturing to managing consumers and maintaining brands. It has resulted in some of the leading EMS companies to set up their operations in India. Br anded P cs outsell assembled ones: With key PC-manufacturing firms expanding their market in India, narrowing the price gap and providing excellent after-sales support, consumers are opting for branded PCs over assembled ones. notebook sales growth surpasses that of Pcs: Notebook sales have driven the PC market in India in 2007–08. With sales exceeding a million units in the second half of the last fiscal, the total sales of notebooks in 2007–08 exceeded 1.8 million units, growing at 114%. Moving from real to virtual: Virtualization creates a virtual version of a server or a platform. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of organizations adopting virtualization, which enhances utilization and significantly reduces costs. adoption of open standards computing: Open standards computing is a philosophy of building IT systems. In hardware, open computing involves the standardization of plug and card interfaces and allows for considerable flexibility in the modular integration of the functions. It also helps in vendor independence. These multiple advantages are the contributing factors for the increasing demand. Rising popularity of ultra-portable notebooks: Small, ultra-portable and inexpensive sub-notebook computers are slated to be the next big thing in the consumer market. Nearly all vendors have launched ultra-portables priced at less than USD 500. growing demand for green data centers: These are energy-efficient, high-performance data centers in which power and cooling are far less expensive and environment-friendly. These features make green data centers more viable and eco-friendly. l l l l l l l lll l l l \u0018\u0018competitive landscape: china and Taiwan The total sales in China are projected to be only 40.61 million units in 2009. According to IDC, desktop sales are expected to record a decrease of 6% to 24.8 million units by 2012. In contrast, the laptop sales in China are projected to increase by 19% to 15.8 million units in 2009. Recommendations Recommendation 1: Attention must be focused on creating robust demand for IT products in the country. Special mission-mode projects for IT inclusion of the common man by 2014: n PC/device and broadband for every school with 1 PC/device per 4 student. n PC/device and broadband for every village with 1 PC/device per 20 people. and by 2020: n PC/device and broadband for every home. Making finance available for IT purchase: n “Priority sector status” should be accorded to IT purchase – hardware, software and broadband for SMBs and households by nationalized/PSU banks as also by NBFCs and micro finance companies. The government should develop programs for concessional loans for these sectors. n The Central Government as well as state governments should provide interest free loans to all their employees for the purchase of IT products. Currently, such loans are available only to officials beyond a certain ranking.l l lKey industry segments challenges challenge 1: Taxation - Frequent changes in taxation have resulted in companies not being able to firm up their long-term business plans, let alone make sizeable investments. It is only in the last two years that there have been no changes in the central levies. The issue is further complicated with state governments, at times, imposing new taxes or changing product classification at their own will. challenge 2: Limited of incentives for investment: With no natural advantage for manufacturing and with uniform taxation across the value chain, sizable investments, especially at the components and sub-assembly level have evaded the segment. Further, due to various reasons, some of the current schemes have been unable to enthuse fresh investments in the segment. challenge 3: Inadequate infrastructure/logistics: The country’s lack of infrastructure, coupled with insufficient international quality logistics, poses a challenge to the growth of the segments.challenge 4: Low broadband penetration: India has 6.8 million broadband connections and only 60 million internet users. Further, the quality of broadband remains much below the desired levels. This has hampered the development of a vibrant content industry, which has led to the absence of a virtuous cycle. Thus, the market for PCs/devices, without a pull factor, continues to remain limited. challenge 5: Slowing growth in domestic consumption: PCs recorded a negative growth of about of 7% in 2008–09. The sales of notebooks that had been growing over 100% for the last consecutive four years declined by 17%. While the sales of PCs have picked up in FY09–10, they are yet to reach the buoyancy of the earlier years.l l l l l it is estimated that iT systems and hardware segment would generate employment for 4.1 million in 2014 and 7.5 million in 2020 from existing 1.9 million in 2009 Source: “IDC: 2009 toughest year for China’s PC market,” China daily, chinadaily.com, accessed 2 October 2009Hardware spend 2007-2012 82Incentivizing the consumer: n 100% depreciation on capital investment in IT – hardware and applications by companies once in a block of three years. n The income tax rebates to individuals for the acquisition of computers once in three years, subject to a limit of INR50,000 and up to INR1,000 per month deduction from taxable income for broadband access. e-governance: n All the existing e-governance projects must be completed by 2014. There is a need to prioritize various projects of the government and track them annually. The annual financial allocation of funds for such projects should be correlated to the targets achieved, and in cases of non-satisfactory performance, the grant should be converted into loans. This should be done for each year between 2010 and 2014, both inclusive. n Encourage the replication of applications by creating a library/database of applications to be drawn on by the Central Government as well as the state and local governments n Take a pragmatic approach to standards and technology investments; focus technology decision-making on outcomes and goals rather than specific technology implementations n Embrace international standards, encourage interoperability and continue the policy of technology neutrality in procurement Mandate all cooperative banks to automate banking operations in each branch by 2014. The above will enable digital access for all, leading to i ndia become a dynamic digital society and economy. Recommendation 2: The current taxation rates extended under the recent fiscal incentive package should prevail long-term to make available products at affordable prices. Recommendation 3: A multi-slab, multi-threshold incentive package such as the Special Incentive Package Scheme (SIPS) should be announced to attract electronics manufacturing Investments at various levels. This is to offset the disability costs suffered by the domestic manufacturers on account of infrastructure and other handicaps. Recommendation 4: The clusters of suppliers of components such as a hard disk, optical disk, CPU, motherboard, etc., should be built close to the assembling plant. A couple of pilot ITIR near Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu and Noida in UP could be considered for the purpose. Recommendation 5: The IT finished goods manufacturing companies, jointly or individually, should engage in a vendor/supplier development program for encouraging local eco-system development.Recommendation 6: The Government of India extends loans/grants to Africa/Latin America, etc., under various bi- lateral programs. All product offerings under such programs should preferably be sourced from domestic companies.l l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 83Key industry segments TElEcoM PRoDucTS anD EquiPMEnT overview Owing to phenomenal growth in recent times, India has become the fastest-growing telecom services market in the world. With 494 million telecom subscribers (wireless and fixed line) at the end of August 2009, India’s telecom subscriber base is second only to China. Telecom services are significant contributors to India’s GDP . There is a 1.2% addition to GDP for every 10% rise in tele-density. This growth has also boosted the telecom electronics and equipment manufacturing segment. India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing markets for global telecom electronics and equipment vendors such as Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Huawei, Motorola and Nokia. key events in indian telecom services space Initiated in 1991, the liberalization process led to the complete deregulation of telecom services. In 1992, the value-added services segment, including mobile services, was open to private participation.The New Telecom Policy, announced in 1994, permitted the entry of one private operator in each circle. In 1997, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) was established as an independent telecom regulatory body.In 2008, the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) announced guidelines for 3G and WiMax spectrum auctions. Segment size: current and projected In FY09, the production of the telecom elec- tronics and equipment segment increased by 11.7% to reach USD 10.5 billion. n This growth was primarily driven by a rise in the demand for wireless services in India, which fueled demand for mobile handsets. n According to the DoT , mobile handset production increased from USD 2.5 billion in FY07 to USD 6.5 billion in FY08, registering a growth rate of 160%. The segment’s production is expected to reach USD 29.5 billion in FY14 and USD 153.5 billion in FY20.l llll l l Source: TEPCTelecom electronics and equipment production (USD billion) The potential to increase exports of telecom electronics and equipment is significant. Telecom equipment: share of exports Source: TEPCDespite the segment’s strong growth of 29.9% annually during FY04–09, only 21.2% of the total production was exported in FY09. China’s contribution to glob- al handset manufacturing is 50% as compared to India’s contribution of 8%. l l 84The demand for mobile handsets is expected to increase from 110 million units in FY08 to 350 million units in FY20. This represents a growth rate of 218.18%, trans- lating to a CAGR of 10.1%. To cater to this burgeoning demand, it is expected that the production of handsets in India will increase from 120 million in FY08 to 505 million handsets in FY20. Further, the average price per handset in is expected to decline to USD 41.5 by FY20, indicating that lower-priced handsets will play a significant role in capturing demand. case for a growing domestic telecom electronics and equipment manufacturing industry Employment generation: Given the right impetus, growth in the segment holds the potential to triple the country’s current employment base by FY14. Significant export potential: According to the Telecom Equipment and Services Export Promotion Council (TEPC), the segment holds an export potential of USD 10 billion by FY14, further strengthening the case for a robust domestic manufacturing industry. Increased competitiveness in the global market: A technologically advanced manufacturing ecosystem in India prospectively offers an international platform to Indian manufacturers. Thus, Indian players can expect to compete globally with established manufacturers in the long run and make their own mark in foreign markets.l l l l l l lgrowth drivers of the segment increasing subscriber base: Despite the urban sector reaching saturation point, the growth of the wireless subscriber base is expected to continue increasing steadily. According to the TRAI, the wireless subscriber base is expected to grow from 457 million in August 2009 to 697 million by 2012. This represents a profitable opportunity for global telecom electronics and equipment manufacturers in India. growth in rural mobile telephony: The rural markets are expected to drive the next phase of growth for telecom services as the urban markets reach saturation point. It is expected that by 2012, the rural subscriber base will account for nearly half of all subscribers with access to telecom services. The strengthening of the rural telecom network will create significant opportunities for telecom electronics and equipment manufacturers. Broadband penetration and connectivity: Broadband subscribers are expected to increase from 6.98 million in August 2009 to 27.3 million by 2012. Rising broadband penetration is expected to further drive growth in the segment. Broadband is an enabler for a wide range of applications such as e-governance, telemedicine and education. Thus, increased broadband penetration and connectivity can significantly impact job creation, innovation and the growth of the telecom electronics and equipment manufacturing industry . 3g /wiMax: The expected launch of 3G services in the near future, offers significant growth opportunities for telecom electronics and equipment manufacturers. The launch will create substantial demand for 3G-enabled handsets.l l l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem Entry-level mobile phones and an increasing rural subscriber base are expected to drive demand in future. Source: EY analysisMobile handset demand estimates (million) *Figures for 2007 and 2008 are actual 85Key industry segments an enabling policy and regulatory environment In an attempt to boost manufacturing in the segment, the Indian government has implemented a series of policy initiatives: The Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) was incorporated in August 1984 as an autonomous body to develop advanced telecommunication technology in the country. The main objective was to establish a center for excellence in the telecom technology domain. The Indian government’s Ministry of Commerce set up the TEPC in 2008 to promote the export of telecom equipment and services. The government has declared that no license was required for the import of all capital goods for manufacturing telecom equipment. The government has also exempted infrastructure telecom equipment from customs duty . No industrial license is required to manufacture telecom equipment. Instead, a simple industrial entrepreneur memorandum (IEM) needs to be filed with the Secretariat for Industrial Assistance (SIA). The government has made a provision of 100% FDI in telecom equipment manufacturing. Recommendations Recommendation 1: Maintain the current taxation structure. n The current taxation structure for mobile handsets must be maintained for the long term growth. Recommendation 2: Encourage the domestic manufacturing industry by creating a strong market pull. n Incentivizing the telecom operators to buy indigenously manufactured telecom electronics and equipment keeping in view the national security concerns. n While awarding large contracts, preference should be given to local players. Recommendation 3: Telecommunication exports should be a part of bilateral trade programs. n Similar to the approach adopted by the Chinese government, telecom exports from India may be included in bilateral trade agreements with emerging markets in regions such as South Asia, Africa, Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe. n Indian trade missions in these regions should proactively seek opportunities in the telecom electronics and equipment domain and facilitate business interactions. Recommendation 4: Provide financial support. n Create an initial fund for R&D and product development for the segment. The Universal Service Obligation (USO) fund may also be utilized for this purpose. Under this fund products can be designed and such designs be given to multiple local manufacturers to produce them for unique local requirements. n Set up an autonomous body, similar to the Telecom Finance Corporation, to assist Indian players in setting up a manufacturing facility and provide guidance. Recommendation 5: Create a mandate for operators to buy Indian equipment. n All telecom operators must be required to have multiple sources and should be required to buy at least 30% of Indian equipment, especially in areas where Indian companies already have globally competitive products. Recommendation 6: Attract investments for accessories. n Create a detailed program to attract investments for accessories such as batteries and chargers for mobile handsets.l l l ll l l l l l l l l 86Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem conSuMER ElEcTRonicS overview Consumer electronic manufacturing was launched in India in the 1950s by the production of radio sets. It was followed by the production of black-and-white TV sets in the 1960s and color TV (CTV) sets in 1982. The Indian government initiated liberalization policies for the segment in 1992, relaxing controls such as licenses and the use of brand names. In 1994, the Indian market was open to major consumer electronic manufacturing multinational companies (MNCs), such as Panasonic, Sony, LG and Samsung. In 2001, non-tariff barriers on imports was removed, and in 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Thailand was implemented, resulting in the reduction of import duties on CTVs, color picture tubes, refrigerators and air conditioners. This led to increased competition with international manufacturers. Currently, MNCs dominate the Indian consumer electronics market, which have major market share in most categories. The growing middle class offers significant market potential to these companies. The demand for premium and luxury products is rising in the urban markets due to changing consumer lifestyles. Low-end products also have a significant market, especially in rural areas. Segment size: current and projected Consumer electronics is the dominant segment of the electronics industry, with a revenue contribution of 27%. During FY09, production in this segment was USD 5.6 billion. For the five-year period, the segment grew at a CAGR of 11.1%. Based on its CAGR, consumer electronics production is expected to reach USD 8.1 billion by FY14 and USD 17.8 billion by FY20.l l llconsumer electronics is the largest segment of the indian electronics industry, accounting for 27% of the total domestic production revenue. The segment holds significant potential for employment generation, with 2 million jobs expected by Fy14 and 25 million by Fy20. Consumer electronics production (USD billion) growth drivers for the consumer electronics segment Digitization: Rapid implementation of digitization in India through media such as TV and radio and the immediate rollout of the conditional access system (CAS) is likely to generate demand for new products in India. Higher disposable income and availability of financing: Disposable income in rising, and consumer financing has become easier. This increased spending on lifestyle products such as TVs, air conditioners and white goods.affordable products: Advanced technology and increasing competition are narrowing the price gap, thereby leading to affordable products in most categories.l ll \u0018\u0018increased organized retail: Organized retail segment is increasing rapidly. Currently the segment is 5% of the total retail market but is expected to grow to 15% by 2015. Establishment of retail chains: The establishment of retail chains such as Croma, E-Zone and Reliance Digital, which exclusively cater to consumer goods, thereby increasing the demand. Shorter replacement cycle: Rising incomes and evolving lifestyles have reduced the replacement cycle from 9–12 years to 4–7 years. The trend of purchasing a second TV within a single household has also increased. The changing dynamics of the segment Rising demand for cTVs: CTVs are the largest contributors to this segment. During FY09, the domestic CTV segment has been estimated to cross 13.5 million units. High-end products, particularly LCD TVs, continue to register a high annual growth rate in FY09. Estimated at 0.8 million units, the LCD market registered more than 130% growth in FY09. LCD TV manufacturing in the country has begun, and as demand increases, the production is expected to increase. growth of the DVD market: Currently, the Indian DVD market is estimated at 7 million units, which is growing at 15% annually. The market size is projected to be 10 million units by 2010. This is driving the sales of DVD players and audio equipment, thus spurring strong growth in the home theater segment. introduction of direct to home (DTh) service: With the introduction of direct to home services, the market for set top boxes (STB) is growing rapidly. Indigenous sources are manufacturing around 25–30% of STBs.Decline in demand for black-and-white televisions: The production of black-and-white TVs continues to decline. Certain medium-scale units have moved to tax-exempted regions, and these units are performing OEM work for other well-known brands. case study: Technology transfer in exchange for access to the domestic market In the late 1980s, the Chinese government adopted the strategy of access to technology transfer in exchange for domestic market (TTEDM). By doing so, the government encouraged MNCs to transfer advanced technology to local manufacturing units in exchange for access to the Chinese market. This incentive, along with the low labor cost and favorable regulatory environment under the export promotion zones (EPZs) scheme, resulted in the relocation of manufacturing units of many consumer electronic companies from the US, the UK, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong to Singapore, South Korea and China. The measures under TTEDM include: Provisions are made for the continuous transfer of advanced technology through joint venture (JV) agreements. The review and approval of certain electronics JVs by the Central Government are mandated to ensure compliance with industrial policies. A foreign direct investment (FDI) limit of 50% has been placed on local manufacturing setups. Labor-intensive JVs are restricted unless 100% export of output is guaranteed. The export of 70% of the output is mandatory . challenges hampering growth of manufacturing in the segment Challenge 1: Significant cost of rural expansion Consumer electronics companies are setting up manufacturing operations in rural areas as land and labor costs in these areas is lower as compared to urban regions. However, expanding operations into rural markets requires significant infrastructural investments. Expenditure on the transportation of inventory to rural areas is greater l ll l l l l l ll ll lKey industry segments \u0018\u0018due to lack of logistical infrastructure. Even LG and Samsung, which are considered to have the largest distribution network in India, have a direct presence only in 15,000 to 18,000 of the 40,000 retail outlets in the country . Power is essential for the use of consumer products. The limited availability of power in rural areas is hampering the penetration of consumer electronics. challenge 2: lack of skilled manpower implies training costs India has abundant manpower. However, the consumer electronics segment requires manpower with specialized experience in electronics. Training is, therefore, an additional investment manufacturers need to make. Recommendations Recommendation 1: Digitize india The need to digitize India is imminent. India should digitize by 2014, this will release the much needed spectrum for 3G and Wimax Services. Further, TV, radio and the immediate rollout of CAS are likely to generate demand for new products in India. Recommendation 2: i ncentivize the rural expansion of consumer electronics manufacturers Consumer electronics manufacturers should be offered incentives to set up manufacturing units and expand distribution networks in rural areas. This is expected to provide access to economical labor as well as increase demand for consumer electronics in India. Recommendation 3: Encourage technology transfer and relocation of manufacturing units Encourage MNCs to set up manufacturing facilities in India either through JVs with local players or relocate their facilities from overseas locations through tax breaks. This will provide India with access to advanced global technologies and create a platform for higher value-added manufacturing.l l l l lElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 89appendix ElEcTRonicS inDuSTR y STaTiSTicS Demand and production statistics Target (USD billion) 2009 2014 2020 Global industry size 1,750 2,000 2,400 Domestic industry size Demand 45 125 400 Production for domestic consumption 16 85 320 Production for exports 4 15 80 Total production 20 100 400 Share in global production 1.2% 5% 16.6% Value addition < 10% 15–20% 30–40% Source: EY Analysis Target (USD billion) 2014 2020 Semiconductor design 20.0 58.2 High-tech manufacturing 4.0 22.6 Electronic components 2.6 3.4 Electronic Manufacturing Services 1.4 2.3 Electronic systems Consumer electronics 8.1 17.8 Telecom products and equipment 29.5 153.5 IT systems and hardware 16.7 54.4 Others (Industrial, Automotive and others) 2.7 7.8Production estimates for key segments Policy anD REgula ToRy EnViRonMEnT Foreign direct investment (FDi) policy The government has established the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to promote foreign investments in the country through international companies, non-resident Indians and other foreign investors. The main objective of the FIPB is to ensure the early clearance of proposals, the periodic review of policies and the establishment of proper institutional arrangements and transparent procedures. Further, to provide impetus to the electronics industry and enhance its export potential, the Electronic Hardware Technology Park (EHTP) and Software Technology Park (STP) have been set up, and offer incentives such as duty free imports, income tax holidays, the exemption of excise duty and other benefits. The main objective behind the implementation of these schemes is to provide a flexible policy environment that would work to enhance the ease of doing business in India.Source: EY analysis 90FDi in electronics industry India received a total FDI of USD 35.1 billion in FY09 as compared with USD 34.3 billion in FY08.

Taiwan has highly developed infrastructure. A drive for an hour on the highway from Taipei to the world famous Hsinchu Science Park, spread over 632 hectares of land, a IT park that houses virtually the all the MNCs in the semiconductor and IT industry, from Acer, chipmaker United Microelectronics to AU Optronics and D Link. The Chinese are replicating the Hsinchu Science Park model for their own IT parks. This park involved the clusters of most of the semiconductor component manufactures, thus saving on time and cost for assembly. This park includes independent wafer foundries, IC design companies, fabricators, as well as packaging and testing companies for the semiconductor industry all at one place. This allows for competition as well as cooperation and integration that is unique. It is a one-stop shop for a company looking for IC products. The availability of high-tech professionals is available in Taiwan. The Hsinchu-based, government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute has hordes of laboratories in which over 5,000 researchers work in close unison with local companies. As a result of this success, more than 40 spin-off park companies have been set up, based on the research. Two universities – National Chiao Tung University and National Tsing Hua University – are sited in the park area providing companies with a regular stream of outstanding professionals. government policies Even government policy is clearly aimed at assisting companies in the park. Companies here are offered bank loans at interest rates that are 2% lower than for loans to companies located in other parts of the city. Companies at the park do not have to pay duties on imported machinery or raw material. In addition, the over 179-member Taiwan Venture Capital Association offers funding. The success of the park has generated a huge corporate demand, so much so that Hsinchu is setting up four new parks spread over 600 hectares across the country for Taiwan’s high tech industry. Taiwan’s IT systems and hardware companies are not quite the low-cost, low-tech outfits that the world commonly perceives them as. Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem 95In a multi-pronged strategy, they are shifting manufacturing to the Chinese mainland and simultaneously drawing on Taiwan’s research and development and high-tech designing skills, supported by research institutes and universities, in addition to building global brands. Notably, capital-intensive work is more prominent in Taiwan, while labor-intensive work is relatively more visible in China. Even the raw material is obtained from China. As a result, over a million Taiwanese work in China, and the two countries have a cordial work relation.Case study: Taiwan 96References “Reinventing The Electronics Manufacturing Industry in India,” CEHA FICCI report MAIT FY09 annual reportDirectory of Indian Electronics Industry 2009, ELCINA“2009 Production Forecasts For The Global Electronics And Information Technology Industries,” Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, December 2008 “India – The Economic Bellwether,” Debasish P .

A decade ago, India was at a similar inflexion point in the information technology (IT) and IT enabled services (ITES) industry that has accounted for 45% of incremental job creation between 1995 and 2005. Much of this success stemmed from government interventions designed to foster growth. As geo–political factors result in India emerging as one of the top–5 markets for defence equipment by 2015, the Indian government could make strategic interventions to replicate success. DEFEncE Global defence equipment procurement is expected to reach approximately USD 250 billion in value in 2009 and will increase by around 30% by 2015 and India will be world’s 3rd largest market for equipment. The key forces shaping the global market are: A shift away from traditional manned platforms to autonomous platforms in developed markets An increased focus on asymmetric warfare and expansion of role of IT in defence resulting from increased levels of cyber crime Increasing thrust on local production riding to counter relying on imports. To benefit from these trends, Indian companies can further harness their core competencies by focusing on opportunities in design and manufacturing such as: n Areas with higher technology intensity such as the integrated software plus hardware play in emerging areas such as homeland security, cyber warfare et al. More so IT spend is likely to be 4% to 5% of total defence expenditure by 2015. n Technology areas that need to be built domestically as global technology transfer is unlikely n Areas where the private sector can collaborate and provide superior execution capabilities to Defence Public Sector Units (DPSUs) such as fabrication Realising this opportunity calls for implementing key recommendations from the Kelkar committee report. In particular, the complete implementation of the Raksha Udyog Ratna Scheme, and modifications to the offset clause for more effective technology transfer. aERoSP acE As demand for aircrafts surges India, China and Russia are expected to account for 15% of global demand over the next 15 years. Three factors are driving industry growth in emerging markets, namely rise of new original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in emerging markets due to major commercial aircraft programmes, more global sourcing from low – cost countries, and outsourcing of R&D to emerging markets. Further, the offset requirement in India could stimulate a geographic shift of investment, approximately US$ 16 billion by 2024 and could help build a niche for India in the aerospace sector. To leverage these market trends Indian players can target at least 3 opportunity areas: n Avionics, engineering design and software opportunities, due to its cost advantages and engineering prowess. n Parts and sub-systems manufacture that can supplied to Tier I/OEMs n Maintenance, repair and overhauling (MRO) business the demand for which is expected to triple from US$ 600 million in 2008 to US$ 1.6 trillion in 2018. l l l l 102nuclEaR The increased focus on environmentally sustainable growth including the global focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is providing a big impetus to nuclear power development. In India, nuclear power is expected to contribute up to 25% to 50% of power generated by 2050, a massive leap from the current 3%. The main opportunity for Indian manufacturers is collaboration with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in manufacturing reactor components. Another opportunity for Indian manufacturers is supplying to global corporations. The 123 Agreement with the United States on civil nuclear cooperation will enable collaboration with leading global companies on new projects. Finally, Indian players can also participate in other parts of the nuclear power equipment value chain like commission et al which amount to 75% of power plant equipment costs Given the sector is dominated by public sector units and other government agencies, private sector participation should be considered. An in-depth study with better involvement of the various government agencies involved in the sector should be undertaken to develop a more detailed perspective. concluSion To achieve these opportunities the government needs to consider three immediate steps: Establish direct and indirect offset policies that will help bridge the gaps in domestic investment and drive technology transfer. Consider IT and Software capabilities as an enabling mechanism, and create an autonomous professional body to manage IT in the defence, nuclear and aerospace sectors. Accelerate the process by which private sector and indigenous participation occurs.l llStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear 103introduction India’s defence, aerospace and nuclear sectors are poised for substantial growth on the back of economic growth and the need to maintain national and energy security. A decade ago, India was at a similar inflexion point in the information technology (IT) and IT enabled services (ITES) industry. By capturing the opportunities at hand, the industry increased its contribution to GDP from 1% to 4% over the decade and created many jobs, accounting for up to 45% incremental of job creation (direct and indirect) between 1995 and 2005. Much of this success was due to government policies that helped foster growth. The expansion of this industry offers lessons on key success factors and government policy in guiding the defence, aerospace and nuclear sectors to similar success. Driven by geo-political considerations, India is expected to be a top-5 market for defence equipment by 2015. Similarly, economic growth and a focus by commercial aircraft manufacturers on low-cost countries are expected to create growth in the aerospace market in emerging markets in general and India in particular. Finally, the civilian nuclear agreement between the US and India will enable commerce and cooperation, in particular allowing India to collaborate with global companies on nuclear projects. Transnational and multi-national co-development and co-production are on the rise and increasingly seen as critical to competitiveness. India has an opportunity to play an important role in this global phenomenon. The developments described above will create attractive opportunities for the defence, aerospace and nuclear sectors in India. The rest of this document describes the context for growth and major trends in each industry and the opportunities for Indian companies. 1041. opportunities in the Defence Sector Defence spending has remained concentrated in developed economies, with the United States alone accounting for 50% of total global spending of USD 1.6 trillion in 2007 (Exhibit 1.1). However, the overall increase in defence spending is heavily weighted towards emerging markets. Between 2002 and 2005, defence spending by Russia and China grew at 18% and 13% respectively, compared to 9.7% in the US. Defence spending in India and Brazil was not much behind that of the US, at 8.6% and 8.3% respectively. Exhibit 1.1 Demand in India for defence procurement is increasing and India can be a top-5 market for defence equipment by 2015. In 2008, India’s budget for defence equipment was USD 9 billion; it is projected at USD 17 billion in 2015, the largest after the United States and China. Indian private sector companies can capture profitable opportunities available in the domestic market if they can tackle several challenges to growth and receive the government support required. FoRcES ShaPing ThE gloBal DEFEncE MaRkET Global defence equipment procurement is expected to reach approximately USD 250 billion in value in 2009 and will increase by around 30% till 2015 (Exhibit 1.2). The following factors will shape demand: a shift away from traditional, manned platforms in developed markets: The market for traditional platforms such as aircraft, submarines and land equipment is large, mature and heavily concentrated. The spending on these traditional platforms are likely to decline by 2-5% p.a. Equipment for digital and homeland security and systems for autonomous platforms will be the highest growth areaslStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear Defence spending is highly concentrated in large countries Source: IISS–Military balance 2007 105an increased focus on asymmetric warfare and expansion of role of iT in defence: \u0018The increase in the number of asymmetric conflicts requires agile forces and responsive equipment. Depending on the type of threat, special military equipment is required for threat detection and asset protection including nonlethal weapons, unmanned combat air vehicles, early warning systems, vehicle protection equipment and satellites. In addition, the role of IT in defence is expanding with the new focus on cyber security. The US is at the forefront of cyber security spending with USD 17 bn approved over the next 5 years and the global market estimate is over USD 8 bn. Defence companies have already begun to acquire niche cyber companies.

However, in recent years, the emphasis has been on improving indigenous defence industry capabilities through local sourcing. This has largely been serviced by the Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) with limited private sector participation. Access to captive domestic demand is a prerequisite of success for defence companies. Other than Israel’s majors, all defence players earn over 75% of revenues from home markets. Furthermore, companies that have successfully globalised with proactive government support typically source more than 70% of requirements domestically. Examples are Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin in the US, which earn around 90% of their revenues in their home market, EADS IN Europe ( 93%), Hindustan Aerospace Limited (97%), Singapore Technologies (63%) and Korean Aerospace Industries (76%). oPPoRTuniTiES in DESign anD ManuF acTuRing FoR inDian coMP aniES To leverage some of these market trends and also exploit its core competencies, India should focus on: Areas with higher technology intensity-Integrated software+hardware play in emerging areas such as homeland security, C4ISR, cyber warfare, systems for UAVs Focus on technology areas that need to be built domestically as it is unlikely to be transferred by global players Areas where the private sector can collaborate and provide superior execution capabilities to Defence Public Sector Units (DPSUs) such as fabrication Based on an extrapolation of the defence expenditure in India as per the Government of India data, the IT services spend from the defence industry is estimated to be ~$0.4-$0.5 billion by 2015.

DPSUs have several advantages over private players. First, they have additional exemptions from select customs and excise duties. There was a move to extend this benefit to private players under the Raksha Udyog Ratna scheme, but it has not been implemented yet. Second, DPSUs enjoy a preference in pricing. To encourage growth by attracting private investment, the government should initiate implementing the key recommendations from the Kelkar Committee Report on the following areas: Provide a level playing field for private players with the DPSUs by awarding the Raksha Udyog Ratna to deserving companies; removing nominations and eliminating price and purchase preference clauses for Indian defence contracts. Tighten offset clauses to provide for more effective technology transfer to India and enlist private sector participation in utilizing investments/business resulting from the offset clausel l l l l l l l lStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear 1072. opportunities in aerospace Demand for aircraft is surging in emerging markets; India China and Russia are expected to account for 15% of global demand over the next 15 years (Exhibit 2.1).

Emerging markets are expected to drive the globalisation of the commercial aerospace industry. Steady growth in passenger numbers—~5% globally mainly driven by ~7% growth in the Asia Pacific region—is expected to create strong demand for new aircraft (Exhibits 2.2 and 2.3). India’s commercial fleet is expected to triple in size by 2018. Exhibit 2.3 Three factors are driving industry growth in emerging markets: The rise of new original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in emerging markets due to major commercial aircraft programmes in these countries (e.g., China, Russia) More global sourcing and a focus on low-cost countries: Global aerospace players are increasingly offshoring engineering and manufacturing in low-cost countries. Canada’s Magellan Aerospace is establishing a low-cost aerospace processing facility in India. The United States’ Lockheed Martin is looking to set up a team of Indian companies providing IT infrastructure support to the company. Outsourcing of R&D to emerging markets: Western OEMs have been outsourcing R&D to emerging markets such as Russia and China for some time now. These countries have been meeting their requirements through their large engineering and aerospace talent pools. Increasing ability of emerging market suppliers to serve western OEMs: China, Russia and to some extent India are able to serve the large aircraft firms Boeing and Airbus as Tier 1/2 suppliers. Many suppliers in emerging markets now have established relationships with western OEMs As development costs are rising, OEMs and super Tier-1 suppliers have started risk-sharing partnerships. Long gestation periods of projects and cost and time over-runs increase the risks of projects. OEMs also want to reduce costs by limiting the number of direct suppliers and want suppliers to invest in design and manufacturing of large work packages. In response, super tier-1 suppliers now provide design, production and integration of major aircraft components.l l lStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear In the near future passenger numbers are expected to grow annually by ~5%, mainly driven by Asia-Pacific with ~7% Airline passenger traffic forecast by region RPKs thousands1 1 RPK = Revenue Passenger Kilometers, typical measure for air trafficdemand; numbers are rounded esimates Source: Bernstein Research 109Finally, the offset requirement in India could stimulate a geographic shift of investment towards India. Offset provisions in India’s defence contracts are applicable to 30% of the total cost of any deal worth over USD 70 million. A foreign company is required to buy defence or other specified equipment from Indian companies. Offset requirements are expected to lead to investments worth USD 16 billion in India up to 2024 and could build a niche for India in the aerospace sector. Parts manufacturing and subcomponent assembly are strongly affected by offset regulations, auguring a possible shift in customer bases to emerging markets. oPPoRTuniTiES FoR inDian PlayERS Indian players have at least three opportunities areas: avionics, engineering design and software opportunities: The key opportunity for India is in aerospace engineering and avionics. This involves six main activities of which a large part of detailed design, testing and software development can be done in India. With a pool of aerospace engineers and a cost advantage over companies in developed economies, India is well placed to attract capacity - and knowledge-driven offshoring. The same factors—talent pool and cost advantage—plus experience in engineering offshoring in other industries also position India well for cost-driven offshoring. Parts and sub-systems manufacture: Indian players can consider manufacturing of standard aerospace parts (e.g., aerospace grade fasteners, casting etc.) and supply them to Tier I/OEMs. In addition, they can focus on complete design, manufacture and assembly of less-complex sub-systems (e.g., cabin components) Maintenance, repair and overhauling (MRo) business: With increased outsourcing of MRO, emerging markets will become the preferred location for these services. In Asia, Japan and Korea have emerged as major locations for engine and component MRO. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have become major centres for heavy maintenance. In India, demand for MRO is expected to almost triple, from around USD 600 million in 2008 to approximately USD 1.6 trillion in 2018 (Exhibit 2.4). Exhibit 2.4l l lOpportunities in Aerospace Growth in aerospace and defense in India will result in rise in demand for after-market services like MRO* and training * Mainrenance, repair and overhaul Source: Aerostrategy, MRO in Asia-Pacific and Middle East (November 2006); HAMCO Website; Lundkvist Fleet database (2008); press search 110Typically, IT spend comprises between 4-7% of revenues for aerospace companies. Aerospace companies are expected to increase their reliance on outsourced services to make up for technical resource shortfalls and cost reduction opportunities. These outsourcing contracts will cover hardware maintenance, application development/implementation, and data center operations. Further, outsourced IT services areas can comprise about 30 % of the total IT spend. The addressable market for offshore delivery of IT and engineering services in civil aerospace can be $0.6-$1.2 billion by 2015. This is based on the following assumptions: The commercial aircraft industry is expected to generate $90 billion in revenues for 2015 (from the current $84 billion) Typical IT spend constitutes 4-7% of revenues while R&D spend constitutes 4-5% of revenues. The engineering design spend comprises ~30% of the R&D spend An estimated 75% of the IT and R&D design spend is offshoreableThere is a 30% labor cost saving in offshoring of IT or engineering design services It must be recognised that not all this opportunity will be captured by 2015. The industry revenues will be driven by how much of the addressable market is penetrated driven by demand, supply and industry conduct considerations.l ll lStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear \u0018\u0018\u00183. opportunities in the nuclear Sector The increased focus on environmentally sustainable growth including the global focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is providing a big impetus to nuclear power development. In India, nuclear power is expected to contribute up to 25% to 50% of power generated by 2050, a massive leap from the current 3%. The 123 agreement between India and the United States opens the way for India to collaborate with international institutions in nuclear power projects. It is also expected to ease any limitations in the supply of uranium required for planned growth. Significant reactor capacity additions are planned in India. They include an estimated addition of 29 new nuclear reactors representing capacity of 20 GWe by 2020. Of these, 11 are expected to be Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and 5 Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). oPPoRTuniTiES FoR inDian PlayERS The main opportunity for Indian manufacturers is collaboration with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in manufacturing reactor components. The domestic opportunity can be substantial. For example, an approximately 25 per cent of a nuclear power plant cost comprises precision-manufactured components (Exhibit 3.1). NPCIL spent over Rs. 3,000 crores to build each of the most recent power plants, Kaiga 3 and 4 (capacity of 220 MWe each). Indian manufacturers could provide NPCIL with reactor core components (e.g., Calandria, a tube and shell thermosiphon reboiler used for distillation or evaporation) or replacement parts (e.g., fuel rods used in fueling machines). More importantly, this represents a significant improvement in costs as a result of developing local suppliers, over 2000 crores saved for TAPS 3 and 4 projects and another 1000+ crores saved for Kaiga 3 and 4 projects. Another opportunity for Indian manufacturers is supplying to global corporations. The 123 Agreement with the United States on civil nuclear cooperation will enable collaboration with leading global companies on new projects. France’s Areva, the United States’ Westinghouse Electric and General Electric, Japan’s Hitachi, and Russia’s atomic energy agency Rosatom are likely to be suppliers for planned projects based on light water reactor (LWR) technology. Indian players can also participate in other parts of the nuclear power equipment value chain including commission, instrumentation, electrical and mechanical components and civil work. These amount to 75% of power plant equipment costs. challEngES FoR inDian PlayERS Indian players will need to build the following capabilities to capture the opportunities available: Manufacturing excellence: Nuclear power plant equipment has stringent manufacturing requirements due to the high safety needs and downtime cost of maintenance. Components must have tolerance levels much more precise than those required of automobile components (e.g., 0.01 micron on a 1-metre part). Meeting these requirements calls for developing manufacturing excellence on all dimensions, which few players in India meet today . Measurement and testing capability: Manufacturers with demonstrated measurement and testing capabilities or those willing to invest in developing them stand to win long-term contracts. Manufacturers will need new measuring equipment (e.g., Talyrond) and new process to perform newer non-destructive testing (e.g., acoustic emissions). Furthermore, inspections may be needed for 100% of the output compared to the sampling approach used in high-volume manufacturing. In addition, certain components take a long time to build. For example, building the entire machining process for a grid plate could take more than a year. Recognising the investments involved and the risks of poor quality, NPCIL prefers to work with a small number of trusted suppliers.l l 112ability to forge long-term partnerships in a consolidated industry: An important success factor would be the ability to forge long-term partnerships with global suppliers. They operate through one of two models. The first is fully integrated manufacturing (as practised by Areva), where the firm controls end-to-end manufacturing with contract-based outsourcing to third parties. The second is an open partnership-based ecosystem (as followed by General Electric), which involves open end-to-end cooperation with third parties across all aspects of the process (from design to manufacturing to service). Indian manufacturers aspiring to participate in the nuclear component industry will need to forge these relationships. For example, GE and Areva are likely to require over 40 million fuelling pins over the next 4-5 years, all of which could be produced in India, representing a significant domestic and expert opportunity. concluSionS Given the size of the aerospace, defence and nuclear market opportunity and current momentum among the private sector players and potential investors, the government has an opportunity to develop a highly strategic and competitive domestic IT industry. It is important to understand that the nature of competition in these industries is not perfectly competitive with significant barriers to trade based on security, economic and geo-political considerations. Industry structure plays an important role in ensuring an efficient and effective industry conduct. In the United States 22 companies were effectively consolidated into four large organizations (Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing and Raytheon), similarly in Europe the merger of 21 companies resulted in the development of 5 major firms (EADS, Thales, FINMICCANICA, Dassault Av and BAE Systems) and in Russia there are now 5 as well. There is a clear need for change in several areas to take advantage of this significant opportunity. To facilitate this we suggest the government consider several immediate next steps including: 1) E stablish Direct and Indirect Offset policies that addresses five specific areas that will help rapidly fill gaps in domestic investment and assist in technology transfer. These are: a) Co-Production (including for IT and control systems where India has clear capabilities), b) Licensing Agreements, c) Local Installation & Assembly, d) Transfer of Technology, e) Purchase of components from India (including nuclear, aerospace and defence related IT and software). A few important considerations in implementing offset policies must be considered - offsets should be triggered above a specific RFP value; consistent with recommendations already made an offset of 30% remains reasonable; special post- contract monitoring mechanisms should be put in place (similar to the 2002 Defence Procurement Procedure) to ensure offsets are genuinely used to build new and critical capabilities. 2) Consider IT and Software capabilities as an enabling mechanism. Significant changes are required to reform current organization and acquisition practices and fix issues such as the mismatch between technological planning & development and R&D, production agencies and users in defence (by example). In addition to the direct role IT and Software industries can play in fulfilling R&D requirements, the industry can provide a platform to improve efficiency and coordination through fast and accurate information availability across the value chain of participants – both public and private, domestic and foreign, while ensuring security concerns are met. 3) Accelerate process by which private sector and indigenous participation happens. For an area such as defence it will be critical to address at least four areas: a) inclusion of private sector in “make” and “buy and make” category of equipment, b) guidelines for participation in “make” category items, c) clarify procurement procedures and d) specifically identify areas such as systems integration, monitoring and test capabilities, that leverages the well established capabilities of indigenous IT and Software players. 4) For IT in defence, nuclear and aerospace sectors in particular create an autonomous professional body that is involved with crafting and executing RFPs/tenders for IT-specific projects/contracts.lStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear"

        "content": "NIC Policy on format of e -mail Address 1. Introduction: National Informatics Center has a nationwide network providing a host of services over the network. One of the critical services being provided is the e -mail service. We are in the process of rationalizing the myriad of e -mail addresses offered by NICNET. The growth of the net work services had been going on at an explosive rate and the time has come for stream lining of the e -mail services by adopting a single virtual e -mail server for the who le nation and achieving address resolution in such an environment. The present Version 1.0 of the “NIC Policy on e -mail address” is a step in that direction. 2. Applicability: This policy is applicable to all the users of the NICNET services. 3. e-mail Address Policy: The major problem that is to be resolved in giving the e -mail addresses to the users is to ensure the address resolution when multiple similar names occur, which is a common occurrence. This problem is found to occur in every nation and therefore there are some proven name resolution methods that have been used by many of the service providers. There are two major naming methods that are used in India. In some parts of India, the “surname” or the “family name” is used to address a person. In some other parts (though in a few states) the “given name” is used for addressing a person. In one state, one gets to see the usage of a large number of initials attached to a given name. Therefore, unlike in the west, where the naming mechanism is uniform, we n eed to take the differences in the naming mechanism to be reflected in the e -mail addresses so that the address resolution problem is properly taken care of on an All India Basis. 4. Policy for Address Resolution: The policy refers to both the e -mail domai ns, which shall be virtual e -mail domains, and the e -mail addresses. 4.1 e-mail addresses: The e -mail addresses shall have a single domain by default “gov.in” and no sub names as in the past. That is all the e - mail addresses that shall be operative over the N ICNET shall have the same unified address part as “@gov.in” Therefore any e -mail address given any where in India over the NICNET shall have the same unified address part “@gov.in” 4.2 e-mail Addresses: The address will have only two parts and in special case s, only one part. That is the address would look like aaaa.bbbb@gov.in . The first part “aaaa” can be either a given name or a family name. The second part “bbbb” will be comprising of either all initials put together o r a family name or given name as the case may be. Below are given a few names that may cause address resolution problems and the proposed method of allocating e -mail addresses is presented. A few examples are given below to illustrate the procedure that wo uld be adopted in allocating the e -mail addresses: 4.2.1. Rakesh Kumar Sehgal Rakesh Kumar Saxena Here, the two e -mail addresses would be: sehgal.rk@gov.in saxena.rk@gov.in 4.2.2. Rakesh Kumar Rakesh Kumar Rakesh Kumar Here, the three e -mail addresses would be: rakesh.k@gov.in kumar.r@gov.in rakesh.kumar@gov.in 4.2.3. In spe cial cases where more than three persons have the same name Rakesh Kumar, then the name of the place where he is working, or the place where he belongs to, or even a number would be added as the additional part based on the user discretion. That is, the e -mail address would be “rakesh.kumar.agra@gov.in ” i.e. name.{dept/min}@gov.in . NOTE: Two character state codes (as per ISO 3166; ref - Appendix - 1) and Four character (2 for state and 2 for districts within state) district codes (as per ISO 3166 -2; ref – Appendix 2) may be used while adding suffix or domain name abbreviation, whenever required. In cases where abbreviations are available from census of India, i s also a valid candidate for this purpose based on the user preference. 4.2.4. S.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy Here the e -mail address would be: ramanamurthy.sbpv@gov.in 4.2.5. S.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy S.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy S.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy Here the three e -mail addresses will be: ramana.murthy@gov.in ramanamurthy.sbpv@gov.in murthy.ramana@gov .in 5. The existing e -mail addresses will be mapped to the corresponding new e -mail addresses and would co -exist till a date that is pre - decided. After that date, only new addresses would become operative. It is also possible to maintain the old e -mail addre sses and the new e - mail address. All outgoing mails will take the new address and system will still accept the mails coming to the old e -mail address for a pre - defined time. 6. Official Addresses/E -mail address for different Govt. Offices : Some conventions h ave to be followed as shown below. 1.Joint-Secretary Ministry of Finance --- js-finance/js -dept-finance 2.Addl-Secretary Ministry of Finance --- as-finance/as -dept-finance 3.Secretary Ministry of Finance --- secy-finance 4.Police Commissioner 5.Resident Commissioner 6. .... 7. .... These addresses are official positions and will remain permanent. These addresses may be mapped to the actual person who is holding the present position. When a new person comes to the same position on transfer, the mapping will be cha nged to new person e -mail id.

Research has been one of the cornerstones of ISA’s activities. ISA is now releasing a study on the Indian semiconductor design industry in collaboration with Ernst & Young India and with the active participation and support of Department of Information Technology, DIT, Government of India. The current report is divided into three sections — the industry analysis, benchmarking of India; and recommendations. Industry analysis focuses on the Indian industry. It discusses the ecosystem for semiconductor design development in areas ranging from intellectual property, talent landscape to the key drivers and challenges. The quantitative benchmarking compares various parameters such as industry dynamics, talent pool, infrastructure, operating costs, quality of business environment and innovation and intellectual property which are important for the development of semiconductor design sector in a country. Finally, based on the findings of these two sections, key issues constraining the growth of the semiconductor design industry are summarized based on which elaborate recommendations are articulated. Government and industry need to reflect on these recommendations. Together, we can ensure that India continues to benefit, grow and prosper from a sector that is marked by innovation and a desire for world-class performance. The concerted efforts of the EY team comprising Sunil Bhumralkar, Sunil Shenoy, Balasubramanian Gurunathan, N Kamalanand, Santosh Premdas, Swapnil Srivastava, Sachin Mehta and Amit Mahendru to meet the timelines of the study are greatly appreciated. The industry core committee has given their time and inputs for the study. Prof. Jamadagni (Indian Institute of Science) has also spared us his time for the report. Our thanks to these individuals. Rajiv Jain and Dr. Vidya Mulky from the Secretariat coordinated the process. We would especially like to acknowledge the Department of IT (DIT), Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), Government of India for supporting the report at every stage to conduct this initiative. Poornima Shenoy President, ISA Dr. Pradip K Dutta Chairman, ISA 7 Executive summaryExecutive summary Key excerpts from the three sections of the report are provided below 1) Industry analysis: The finding of the industry analysis demonstrates the growth of the Indian semiconductor industry, which comprises VLSI design, embedded software development and hardware/ board design, and had an estimated value of US$ 7.5 billion in 2010. Increasing consumer electronic goods sales, a burgeoning telecom/networking market and significant growth in the use of portable/wireless products is a trend being seen in India, which is driving the growth of the semiconductor design industry. • Overall semiconductor industry drivers and challenges: Adequate availability of the talent pool, the maturity of the Indian semiconductor industry and stringent IP protection measures are driving this industry, but the lack of a semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and of quality in specialized skills, competition from other Asian countries and eroding cost advantage are seen as major challenges. Venture capital activity, especially at the seed fund stage, is still not as mature as in the IT/ITeS industry. • India’s talent scenario: India’s abundant talent pool continues to play a major role in the country’s position in global semiconductor design vertical, which employed a workforce of 160,000 in 2010. The industry has a young workforce with close to 78% consisting of B.Tech graduates and close to 60% with less than eight years of work experience. However, the lack of product conceptualization and management as well as analog design skills are some talent-related challenges that need to be addressed. • VLSI design: Almost 50% of the work conducted in VLSI design is in the gate range of 1M–10M, and more than 50% of the work is carried out in the digital design segment, but mixed signal design work is rapidly increasing. In terms of design, IP development and module design and verification garner the major share of projects. The main growth drivers include: • The increasing maturity of the Indian design ecosystem • The rising demand for electronics products globally, which is driving VLSI industry Some of the notable challenges in this segment: • Lack of scale at the leading node • Lack of R&D funding in universities. • Embedded software design: The embedded software industry contributes close to 80% to the Indian semiconductor industry’s revenues, with the key consuming verticals being telecom/networking and consumer electronics products. Factors that provide an impetus to this segment include: • Product customization due to localization and legislative requirements • Lower entry barriers • Adaption to open-source platforms The main challenges faced in the embedded software segment include: • Cost pressures due to constantly evolving platforms • Skill-set availability for high-end programmers • Preference for ADM services as a career option • Hardware/Board design: The hardware/board segment is the smallest contributor to the semiconductor design industry in India. More than 50% of the work is conducted in the sub-10 layers range. Factors that aid in the growth of this segment include: • Increased outsourcing by service providers • Re-engineering opportunities • Captives partnering third-party service providers and bringing in increased business This segment is hindered in growth by the following: • Compliance-related challenges • Lack of semiconductor ecosystem 2) Benchmarking study: This study was conducted with the aim to quantitatively compare India with seven other countries, which are considered the pioneers in semiconductor design, on the parameters relevant for this industry. The representative set of countries chosen consists of the US, the UK, Germany, Sweden, China, Taiwan and Israel. The 20 benchmarking parameters that were considered for the study are important for the development of a country’s semiconductor design sector. These parameters can be broadly classified under the following heads — industry dynamics, talent pool, innovation environment, operating cost, infrastructure and the quality of the business environment. The following are the key findings from the benchmarking exercise: • Industry dynamics: India has a fairly well- developed semiconductor design industry, with 120 design units. Several global integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) have established their captive design centers in the country, which ranks the second among the sample set of countries in terms of design revenues. The country’s electronics market is growing rapidly and is expected to boost the demand for semiconductor components in the future. • Talent pool: India is a strong performer on its talent parameters and features among the top three in the sample set in terms of the engineers employed in its semiconductor design sector. This is due to the required degree graduates being produced each year, who have the requisite skills to be employed in the country’s design sector. India also has the highest number of engineering colleges among the sample set of countries. • Innovation environment: India is seeing rapid evolution in its innovation environment due to the availability of its skilled talent pool and high- quality scientific research institutes. The country ranks favorably among the sample set countries in terms of the number of IEEE papers filed by it in the fields relevant for semiconductor design. India however lags behind other sample set countries in terms of company spending on R&D. • Operating cost: India is highly competitive in terms of operating costs for businesses and ranks among the top few in the sample set in terms of the salaries of semiconductor design professionals and Grade A office space rentals, which form a major portion of a company’s costs. In terms of the cost of raising debt and electricity costs, India ranks among last countries in the sample set, although both these parameters do not comprise a major portion of the operating costs of companies. • Infrastructure: India ranks among the top countries in the sample set in terms of its future availability of office space. However, the country’s economy is still power-deficient. On the positive side, in the last few years, India has overcome its internet bandwidth constraints and now has ample capacity to provide high-speed international connectivity to companies.• Quality of business environment: India lags behind other countries in the sample set in terms of the overall quality of its business environment. There are innumerable procedures required to start a new business in the country. Corporate taxation rate in India is also among the highest in the sample set, but the country performs better than other developing countries in the sample set in terms of the efficiency of its legal framework. 3) Recommendations for the Indian semiconductor design industry: Based on the findings of the industry analysis and benchmarking exercise, the key challenges constraining the growth of the semiconductor design industry are summarized below: i. Quality, availability and maturity of talent ii. Absence of a start-up and SME ecosystem iii. Lack of a semiconductor ecosystem iv. Lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and implementable incentives v. External issues affecting the Indian semiconductor industry Each of these issues has been tackled in detail, with detailed recommendations in this report. These recommendations require the concerted and coordinated effort of the Government, industry and the academia to help India reach the next level of growth and achieve the specific goals envisaged for the Indian semiconductor design industry, which include the following: Maintain leadership in semiconductor design by incubating 50 fabless semiconductor companies, each with the potential to grow to US$ 200 million in annual revenues by 2020Goal 1 Build on India's favorable intellectual property protection image and make it among the top 5 destinations for intellectual property creation in the semiconductor design industry Goal 2 Capitalize on indigenous demand in strategic sectors to provide impetus to the Indian fabless semiconductor industry Goal 3 Sustain and nurture high-class semiconductor design manpower at a growth rate of 20% year-on-year to double its current output levels to reach a workforce size of 400,000 in the next five yearsGoal 4 This study on the Indian semiconductor and embedded design services industry has been commissioned by the Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, India, with the intention of providing a thorough and systematic analysis of the Industry. It highlights India’s growth and positioning in the global semiconductor design industry to identify areas of improvement and frame recommendations for the Indian semiconductor design industry. This report is jointly prepared by the India Semiconductor Association and Ernst & Young Pvt. Ltd. The output of the study is presented in three sections:About this study Section 1: Industry analysis This section throws light on the global semiconductor design and embedded software industry with a focus on the Indian industry. It discusses the ecosystem for semiconductor design development, the status of intellectual property in the industry and the talent landscape.

The semiconductor industry has entirely changed the outlook of the world we live in today. The industry is one of the key drivers of growth, not just for a few electronics appliances but of the entire electronics value chain. As illustrated below, from a worldwide base semiconductor market of US$ 226 billion in 2009, the industry enables the generation of electronics systems and services, which account for about 10% of the total world GDP. Moore’s Law, based on the observation made by Intel Co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, is a principle, which states that the number of transistors per square inch on Integrated Circuits (ICs) had doubled every year since ICs were first invented. Moore predicted that this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. Semiconductor designers shrink the transistors on chips so that electrons have less distance to travel, which expedite processing of data. This method is becoming harder to perform, as circuits are packed so closely that chips are heating up and their performance is beginning to suffer.

While the market growth rate of the industry is slowing down, costs within it are not. Furthermore, continued technology convergence or integration is leading to an increase in the complexity of devices, which is escalating design costs. Additionally, it is predicted that continued integration is likely to cause certain standalone chip markets to become inconsequential as individual functions are fused into bigger chips, which is expected to result in a smaller number of chip types being produced by fewer vendors. This is likely to lead to further consolidation in the industry over the next few years. The industry is research- and development-intensive at the design stage and capital-intensive during the manufacturing phase. This is accompanied by continuous growth in a cyclical pattern with high volatility. Generally, cycles include an expansion and peak period, followed by a slowdown phase, and eventually a downturn stage, as illustrated in the figure below. The industry has witnessed six major cycles since 1970, and there is good reason to believe that 2009 marked the end of the downturn phase of another cycle. These cycles and their volatility have meant that players in the industry are aware of the critical need for a high degree of flexibility and innovation to constantly adjust to the rapid pace of change in the market. Exhibit 3: Cyclical nature of global semiconductor industry Expansion and peak phase 2–3 years of strong (20%) growth Expansion and peak phase Source: EY research 2010Downturn phase 1-1–2 years of flat or declining growth Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry16 Current global semiconductor industry There has been a drastic fall in the year-on-year growth of the global semiconductor industry, beginning in 2008, with a maximum decline of 9.0% in 2009. Initial estimates indicated less significant revenues of US$ 219.7 billion in 2009, but the industry had evolved since the earlier 2001 boom-bust period and was quick to adapt to prevailing conditions. Therefore, it witnessed higher-than-expected revenues of US$ 226.3 billion in 2009. Some factors that initially led to this decline over 2008–2009 included: • Fall in end-market demand Falling demand in almost all semiconductor end markets had a huge impact on industry revenues. While the communications industry saw less significant growth rates of 5.8%, as compared to 7.9% earlier, the automotives industry was not as fortunate and witnessed a fall of 14.9%. Almost all end markets saw a decline or lower growth rates, resulting in an overall fall in the demand for semiconductors as well • External macroeconomic factors Difficult macroeconomic conditions due to the recession led to lower disposable incomes, and hence, lower consumer consumption, which played a key role in falling semiconductor revenues. The global economic crisis had a profoundly negative impact on almost all industries, including the semiconductor industry • Cyclical behavior The cyclic nature of the industry may also have been responsible for the decline in 2008–2009. This would suggest that the last quarter of 2009 was leading into the upturn period that follows a dip in the semiconductor industry cycle. The dip may have been too short to be considered part of a regular cycle, but these cycles are getting shorter in length due to the rapid inventory re-adjustments that are now possible and the buffer that fab-less companies have when they outsource their manufacturing operation to third-party foundries. The recessionary impact is clearly seen in the graph above, indicating that there was decline of 2.8% in 2008 and a further decline of 9% in 2009.Exhibit 4: Global semiconductor industry Source: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), 2009227248256 249 2266.8%8.9% 3.2%-2.8% -9.0% -10%-5%0%5%10% 210220230240250260 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Growth (%)USD billions Revenues GrowthII. 17 Section 1: Industry analysis Industry segmentation by product category The overall semiconductor industry is fairly fragmented and each segment or sub-segment has its own group of key competitors. The following trends have been observed in the various segments of the industry: • ► Discrete semiconductors — diodes, transistors, etc. • These typically perform a single function in electronic circuits, the purpose of which is switching, amplifying or rectifying and transmitting electrical signals. The discrete segment is expected to grow from US$ 14.2 billion to US$ 21.6 billion during 2009– 2012. The growth of the segment is usually quite stable, relative to the overall industry, due to its lower presence in computer applications • ► Optoelectronics — electrical/ optical or optical/ electrical transducers • This is a separate segment as different technology and processes are required to manufacture optoelectronics, as compared to integrated circuits or discrete semiconductors. The optoelectronics segment is expected to grow from US$ 17.0 billion to US$ 26.8 billion during 2009–2012. This growth is expected to be mainly driven by the use of optoelectronics in digital cameras, and especially in cameras in multimedia mobiles and handsets • ► Sensors — sense physical quantity and convert it to electrical signals. • Although a relatively small segment of the overall industry, sensors are expected to see a sizeable growth from US$ 4.8 billion in 2009 to US$ 7.9 billion in 2012. The increasing need for sensors in digital applications, which may have previously been analog, should be a strong driver of growth for the segment. • ► Integrated circuits (ICs) — miniaturize electronic circuits, integrating a large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip • Integrated circuits comprise the bulk of the semiconductor industry, accounting for around 84% of the industry in 2009. The discrete segment has become a smaller segment as an increasing number of integrated circuits can perform the functions carried out by Integrated circuits. The segment has sub-segments including analog, memory, micro and logic components. It is expected to grow from US$ 190.3 billion in 2009 to US$ 275.0 billion in 2012.

During the global recession, sales in the Asia Pacific remained flat, whereas that in the Americas and Europe witnessed a steep decline. Worldwide semiconductor growth in recent years has been largely driven by the increasing demand for consumer electronics such as portable music players, mobile phones and flat screen televisions. With many of these products being manufactured in Asia, along with growing consumption electronics in these countries, explains why sales to this region are so large. The Asia-Pacific region surpassed the Americas to become the world’s largest region for semiconductor sales in 2001, and since then, its lead has increased every year. Key end vertical consumption trends and demand evolution These various segments of the semiconductor industry lead to their various applications in end markets ranging from consumer electronics to communications. The following are the key end market growth drivers: Exhibit 6: Geographic split of global semiconductor market, 2009 Source: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)South Korea 4.5%India 5.1%Rest of APAC 5.2% Europe 13.0%Americas 17.0%Japan 17.0% China 38.1% Asia–Pacific (APAC) 52.9% Exhibit 7: Geographic growth trends of the global semiconductor market, 2005-2010E Source: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)-30.0%-20.0%-10.0%0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0% 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010EYear -on-year growth rate (%) Americas Europe Japan Asia Pacific 19 Section 1: Industry analysis • Data processing market This market has seen strong demand from emerging countries while witnessing a recovery in sales in enterprise sector through new products. The benefits of these new products are driving hardware upgrades among enterprises. However, the main growth driver in the computing market is expected to be mobile computing platforms. The growth of the cloud computing and data center segments may also play a significant role • Consumer electronics market Key products such as LCD TVs and blu-ray players are also a major driver of revenue, even with their low margins. These margins are the result of aggressive pricing due to the intense competition in the market. The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has indicated that the fall in revenue in 2009 was the result of weak pricing as actual unit volumes of consumer goods increased. There is also expected to be a general global trend of switching from analogue to digital broadcasting of TV signals, driving the growth in high-resolution TVs and digital set top boxes • Automotive industry The increased need for, e.g., navigation and fuel efficiency for vehicles in the automotive industry, is driving the growth for electronic content per vehicle. As automobiles have a longer lifespan than consumer goods, semiconductors for automobiles tend to generate revenue for a number of years, realizing a stable business model with a strong growth profile for the future • Communications The growth in cell phone sales has led to that of semiconductors such as analog chips and microcontrollers, which are used in wireless communication. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the key drivers in this segment include higher connectivity, increased storage and multimedia-enabled handsets and smartphones. • Industrial Environmental-friendly technology, as well as energy-efficient technologies such as smart meters and smart grid, is driving the growth of the industrial segment. Semiconductors in this segment are mainly focused in the areas of control and power, and the largest number of installed components include logic, MCUs and DSPs.

Semiconductors, which enhance the practicality of these cars, e.g., increased battery efficiency, are expected to lead the way. • Medical and healthcare applications With an augmented healthcare applications industry and personal home healthcare applications, there should be a significant increase in the need for semiconductors in these applications as well. • ► Key areas • Energy efficiency Renewable energy in the form of solar panels, etc., is expected to be at the forefront with increasing global awareness of the need to conserve energy. Semiconductors are likely to play a big role in electrical energy creation by enhancing the design of solar panels. • Embedded intelligence While driving consumer growth, these are also critical for generating opportunities for convergence. • Sensors and detectors The need for security and related applications in the modern world, as well as its requirement for sensors and detectors, should be the growth driver for semiconductors as well. 21 Section 1: Industry analysis Challenges Although the semiconductor industry is being driven by so many different factors, there are still some major issues faced by the industry. Some of these include: • Timing of delivery of products The timing of delivery in some segments such as consumer electronics and mobile devices is crucial because of the fast-changing nature of the demand for these products — the demand for a current chip may begin to dip rapidly and delays in delivery would mean substantial loss of profits as well as market reputation. • Technology changes Rapid technology changes, increasing complexity and the increasingly complex equipment required to cope with these changes result in high costs. • Prices Falling prices due to fierce competition, commoditization and rising pressures from OEMs for lower prices have led to declining profit margins. • Macroeconomic conditions A weak economy or end market conditions may result in falling demand. Global semiconductor industry projections Although the industry was heavily impacted by the recession in 2009, the sharpest decline it has seen since 2001, forecasts for 2010 were very encouraging, with a year-on-year growth of 28.6% and projected revenues of US$291 billion. According to reports, these forecasts are on track with semiconductor sales exceeding expectations. Some of the key factors that are driving this growth include: • Production cuts Semiconductor manufacturers are increasingly aware of the risk of excess stock after the boom bust of 2001. As soon as the recession began taking effect in late 2008, manufacturers responded by drastically cutting their production levels instead of running their production lines at full capacity with the hope of maintaining their margins when the recession died down. Consequently, there was no excess stock; in some cases a shortage was seen, which, in turn, led to higher pricing. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry22 • Consumer electronics and PC markets The return to strength in consumer electronics and PC markets toward the end of the year accounts for around 60% of global semiconductors sales. New product launches, e.g., of netbooks and more complex chip content in products such as LCD TVs, contributed to the process. • Increasingly diverse end markets The global shift toward energy efficiency and alternative energy is driving and creating semiconductor sales in emerging markets (as well as in medical equipment). • Pricing Effective inventory management during the recession meant that there was a supply shortage, given the demand. This created an upward pressure on prices, which rose significantly. It is also important to note that the phenomenal industry growth of 28.6% was just a return to normal growth in 2010, but seems inflated in comparison with recession-impacted 2009 figures. If compared to 2007 revenues of US$ 256 billion, 2010 figures represent a more standard growth of 13.7%.

Evolution of semiconductor design industry in India The semiconductor industry was initiated in India in the late sixties with the establishment of discrete semiconductor device R&D and manufacturing in the Germanium and Silicon technologies, and the first saleable integrated circuits (both digital and analog) were made and marketed. This marked the country’s first step toward semiconductor R&D and led to the establishment of global incumbent semiconductor companies such as Texas Instruments (1985) and Arcus (acquired by Cypress Semiconductor). The evolution of the domestic semiconductor design industry can be classified into four phases. a. The exploratory phase (Pre1995): This phase saw the initiation of semiconductor design in India with the establishment of state-run companies, which produced discrete Germanium semiconductors and some multi-national companies such as Texas Instruments, which were looking to test the Indian waters and were the first movers in tapping the Indian opportunity. b. The IT industry-led growth phase (1995 –2000): With the growth of the domestic IT industry in India, coupled with the increasing number of English-speaking engineers,, an ecosystem developed, which led to the entry of an increasing number of domestic and MNC companies such as Analog Devices, National Semiconductor, Delphi Automotive Systems and Synopsys. c. Explosive growth phase (2000 –2005): This phase marked the highest growth of semiconductor design companies in India, which led to the establishment/entry of about 42% of the companies currently operating in the country. This was primarily driven by strong government support and rapidly evolving educational institutions, which began offering advanced courses in semiconductor design. d. Innovation phase (2005 onwards): With the top 10 global cable companies and the top 25 semiconductor companies present in India, the ecosystem is gradually orienting toward product/ design innovation. Both captives and non-captives are gradually orienting themselves to execute projects of enhanced strategic value (toward spec-to- tape out/ product ownership). Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry24 By 2005, a large number of global semiconductor companies had set up captive design units in India, which explains the peak in the number of companies established before 2005 as shown below. Current and future semiconductor design industry size in India The semiconductor design industry in India, consisting of VLSI design, board/hardware design and embedded software development, was estimated to be US$ 6.5 billion in 2009 and is expected to log a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% over the next three years to reach US$ 10.6 billion in 2012. The major contributor to these revenues is embedded software development, followed by VLSI and board design. The increasing availability of a capable talent pool, coupled with the emergence of India as a consumer market for electronic goods, has led to the increase in work being done to India.Source: ISA—EY research 2010Exhibit 10: Evolution of Semiconductor Design Companies in India by number of companies and year of incorporation (cumulative growth) 1018357088 711173240 37183848 8 years 29% Male 80%Female 20%Exhibit 22: Semiconductor design industry split by gender, 2009 Source: ISA Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry36 Special Manpower Development Programme – Phase II During the Ninth Plan, the Department of Information Technology (DIT) aimed to increase India’s share of the global VLSI design market from around 0.5% to around 5.0%. In view of the availability of quality human resources for achieving this target as the key catalyst, The DIT initiated a “Special Manpower Development Programme in the area of VLSI Design and related Software,” which comprised 19 institutions (7 resource centers (RCs) and 12 participating institutions (PIs) in 1998. The objective of this program was to carry out research and guidance in VLSI- related areas with the establishment of VLSI Design Labs at resource centers and participating institutions by training graduates, post graduates and at the doctoral level.SMDP II, which started in the year 2006, is currently present across the country and of 32 institutions, consisting of 7 resource centers and 25 participating institutes, participate in it. The talent pool generated from SMDP II of DIT, in terms of the number of students for the academic year 2009–2010, according to our estimates from discussions with resource centers and participating institutes, is a total of 5471. The individual breakup comprises: • ► Type I – 58 • ► Type II – 672 • ► Type III – 892 • ► Type IV - 3849 Fresh graduate talent supply Engineering is the preferred educational stream for Indian youth, as a result of which India produces around 361,000 engineering graduates every year. This includes graduates as well as post graduate degree holders. • Relevant engineering talent for the semiconductor design industry: • Computer science • Software • Electronics and communications • Electrical and electronics • Information Technology (IT) India produced around 222,000 fresh engineering graduates in these streams, comprising nearly 62% of the total engineering turnout, in 2009. Exhibit 23 showcases the growth of fresh engineering talent over five years. 37 Section 1: Industry analysis The fresh graduating population relevant for the semiconductor design industry is set to grow at a CAGR of around 11% to more than 300,000 by 2013. This growth is expected as a result of the following policies and measures implemented the Indian Government. Grants program: To motivate students to opt for higher education at the doctorate level, the Government has launched a couple of grants programs. UGC selects 50 candidates each year for Junior Research Fellowships. Inclusion program: To promote technical education for women, handicapped and the weaker sections of the society, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has introduced its Tuition Waiver Scheme for women, economically backward and physically handicapped meritorious students in technical institutions. Improvement in quality of education: The percentage of fresh talent from tier 1 institutes such as the IITs and the NITs is geared to increase due to the proposed increase in the number of these institutes. Hence, the quality of talent available that is to be deployed in the semiconductor design industry is also set to improve.Exhibit 23: Fresh graduate supply in India Source: NASSCOM Strategic Review, 2010, EY research328361401444493 201222247274305 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Fresh graduate talent (in '000) Total engineering talent Relevant engineering talent11% Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry38 Split of talent supply by type of degree The type of degree (B.Tech or M.Tech) is an important parameter to determine the proportion of specialized talent available. India has a significant number of post graduates graduating every year and the number has grown substantially in the last one year. However, the number of graduates is still much larger due to the Government’s focus on the first level of higher education.

Institutes such as the IITs and NITs have tough entry criteria, excellent faculty and renowned alumni. Around 6% (approx. 13,000) of the graduates, who may be relevant for the semiconductor design industry, graduate from tier 1 institutes such as the IITs and NITs. Location split of universities offering relevant degrees The location split of engineering colleges and universities is an important parameter to define the catchment area of relevant talent for semiconductor companies. India can be divided into five geographical regions — northern, eastern, western, southern and central. The split of states is as follows: Exhibit 27: Split of fresh talent by university tier (percentage split of the relevant talent pool), 2010 Source: HRD Ministry’s Annual Report 2009-2010, Admission boards of IITs and NITsIIT, 3%NIT, 3% Others, 94% Region States Northern Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh Eastern Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura, Jharkhand, Nagaland, Orissa and West Bengal Western Maharasthra and Goa Southern Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu Central Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh Source: AICTE Exhibit 28: Location split of universities offering relevant degrees Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry40 Most of the universities are based in the southern region. Andhra Pradesh accounts for a major portion of the chunk. The second highest is the northern region constituting the states of Bihar, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Gender ratio of fresh talent supply Gender ratio is an important parameter to gauge the extent of diversity in the talent pool of a particular region. India’s talent pool is still skewed toward the male population. Around 18% of fresh engineering graduates in 2009–10 were women. However, the Government has put several programs in place to ensure inclusion of women. • Around 85% of the target beneficiaries of the SAAKSHAR BHARAT (the national literacy mission) will be women. • Mahila Samakhya is an ongoing scheme for education and empowerment of women in rural areas.Exhibit 30: Gender ratio of fresh talent supply (% split of the relevant talent pool), 2010 Source: HRD Ministry’s Annual Report 2009-2010Male graduates, 82%Female graduates, 18%Exhibit 29: Geographic split of universities offering relevant degrees, 2010 Source: AICTE295213635997 2842424 Central Eastern Northern Southern Western Total Number of engineering institutes 41 Section 1: Industry analysis India’s talent analysis summary The current workforce in the semiconductor design industry in India was estimated at around 135,000 in 2009 and is expected to grow at 20% to reach 230,000 by 2012. Around 70% of the installed workforce has experience of more than three years. Women constitute around 22% of this workforce, with a the majority of them working in the VLSI and embedded segments. • India produces around 222,000 fresh engineering graduates every year and this is expected to grow at the rate of 11% over the next two to three years. The majority of these students come from the southern part of the country, since the south Indian states (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala) have the maximum density of engineering colleges. • This pool of engineers consists of 8% (around 18,000) post graduates. • Around 6% of graduates, who are relevant to the semiconductor industry, come from tier 1 institutes such as the IITs and NITs. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry42 VLSI design industry VLSI design is the process of designing integrated circuits by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip, and involves various design activities ranging from specification to tape-out of the chip, as described in the next section. The total revenue from VLSI design in India was estimated at US$ 826.7 million in 2009 and is expected to log a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% over the next three years. The blended and fully-loaded cost per Full Time Employee (FTE) per month is close to US$ 4,300 currently and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.7% over the next three years to reach US$ 4700 in 2012. This increase in costs balances the increasing wage inflation and facility costs with scale benefits. These rates saw a bit of correction to 2007 rates due to the impact of the recession. One way in which the recession was managed was to change the skill-set mix by increasing the number of “freshers” to the lateral hiring ratio to lower average fully-loaded costs. VLSI still commands premium rates over the board and embedded segments, mainly due to the complexity of the work involved and market competition for available talent.IV.

Although Japan is home to a very large number of electronic product companies requiring design services, various challenges such as language, culture, etc., have hindered VLSI requests for design business from Japan. Of late, many companies are targeting Japan, and it is widely expected to become a major revenue source in the future. End-to-end product ownership seldom occurs in India, since it is solely a function of being proximal to the customer, although we are beginning to see a change in this, with captives as well as some third-party service providers building capability to provide services in the entire value chain. Since India currently does not play host to customers of semiconductor companies (OEMs, ODMs, etc.), higher end activities in the design flow, such as specification definition and architecture design, are restricted to the global or regional head quarters of companies, which directly interact with their customers. Additionally, another reason why total product ownership does not occur in India is that most global semiconductor companies follow a distributed and collaborative development methodology across various countries in multiple geographies. Hence, no single center has total ownership of a product or product-related decisions. In the case of third-party service providers, captives are comfortable outsourcing total design -related activities from RTL coding or verification to tape-out for derivative products, but have restricted design outsourcing of current generation products to lower complexity activities in the design flow. Recessionary impact on VLSI design industry in India Of the companies interviewed, several indicated that the economic downturn of 2008–2009 had not had a major impact on the VLSI design industry in India. During this time, the majority of global semiconductor companies stalled their new products and aggressively focused on derivative product development and design, which resulted in the offshore Indian captive centers of these semiconductor companies getting additional work. Exhibit 33: Activities in the VLSI design flow Source: ISA—EY research 2010Architecture RTL coding RTL verification Tape–out Back–end Synthesis To foundry Design related activity Non–design related activitySpecification Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry44 Third-party service providers also indicated that they had been relatively immune to the recession due to two major reasons: • Since most of the product development was on derivative chips, they were able to secure a significant number of customer wins. • The recession also led them to explore alternative local revenue streams, which opened up new markets such as defense and avionics in India. However, there is an overall semiconductor design industry consensus that the impact of the recession was felt in India with growth getting delayed, increased cost pressures, a significant number of programs getting canceled, an increased percentage of employees on the bench and potential hiring plans put on hold. Furthermore, the industry indicated that the positive outlook provided in interviews was due to hindsight while looking at the recession and the sharp slap-back effect with which the recession bounced back. Every recession brings in its wake higher quality of work, and this one also forced third-party service providers to look at new business models, which complimented their current service portfolios with IP- based solutions or a reusable framework for better revenue realization. Key consuming industry segments for VLSI design With the increasing global demand for communications and consumer products, consumer electronics products consist of the bulk of the VLSI design industry pie. Although the PC market is still the largest for chips, the demand for mobile phones and digital TVs is expected to spur the design industry again as the economy has begun to recover. New drivers of growth, such as increasing digitization of products and anytime/anywhere connectivity, have caused vendors to expand the application of existing products to alternative end markets and develop new applications for biometric security markets, digital power supplies and gaming devices. The telecom sector is expected to continue its dominance as compared to 2007 levels, although it is expected to hit a plateau in terms of growth. The portable/wireless industry is also driving growth with applications in connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, UWB, WiMax, NFC and the automobile electronics and healthcare segments expected to see a small amount of traction. 45 Section 1: Industry analysis Exhibit 34: VLSI design projects split by consuming industry segment, 200 –2011 2009 2010 2011 Telecom/Networking products31% 30.40% 30.00% Industrial/Power electronics products4.50% 4.00% 3.80% Portable/Wireless products 14.80% 15.20% 15.40% Consumer electronics products34.50% 34.80% 35.00% Automobile products 4.30% 4.50% 5.00% Healthcare 3.90% 4.00% 4.00% Storage 4.40% 4.50% 4.20% Others 2.60% 2.60% 2.60% Source: ISA Indian VLSI design industry operations – quantitative analysis Distribution of total projects carried out in India by gate count (complexity) The industry continues to see large traction with almost 50% of its projects in the 1M–10M gate range, although with technology nodes moving to 65nm and below range, there is increased activity in projects in the 10M–20M gate range. As the number of gate counts are increasing and technology nodes are moving into lower sub-micron ranges, various challenges are beginning to surface, some of these including the quantum-mechanics phenomenon, thinner wires offering larger resistance, parasitics such as capacitive and inductive coupling between parallel wires and electro-migration.

Digital signal designs are more standardized, use simplified device models, work with easily available EDA tools and there is an abundant supply of talent in India. However, the percentage of work carried out in the analog industry is expected to remain constant due to the dominance of eastern European countries in the industry. Other reasons for this include the need for customizable synthesis tools, difficulty in testing designs and shortage of talent due to lack of training focus and the need for specialized analog lab infrastructure, resulting in competition for already available talent. Distribution of total projects carried out in India by type of design As the industry is maturing, companies have confidently begun developing their IP and investing in it. This is in line with the trend of captives partnering with third-party service providers by participating in early chip development programs and providing modular IPs to reduce their time-to-market. The share of projects in the module design and verification space has gradually declined over the last two years.

Breakup by educational qualifications The industry is dominated by engineering graduates, who constitute nearly two-thirds of the entire workforce. VLSI design requires specialized skill-sets, and hence, the presence of a large number of postgraduates, as compared to the other two segments, particularly the board/hardware segment.Exhibit 38: VLSI design industry workforce in India, 2009-12 (in ‘00s) Source: ISA—EY research 2010141172206252 2009 2010 2011 201220% Exhibit 39: VLSI design industry split by educational qualification, 2009 Source: ISA—EY research 2010Bachelors in technology 73% Masters degree 22% Diploma holders 3%Ph.D 2%Others 1% Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry48 Experience-wise and diversity ratio distribution of employees The distribution of the workforce is rather skewed toward more experience, mainly due to the presence of an older and mature VLSI industry workforce in India and a substantial number of VLSI designers, who are returning to India from abroad to join captives or service provider firms. Employees with more than three years of work experience account for close to 60% of the entire workforce in the country. Although the VLSI industry largely comprises men, the percentage of women in this sector has grown slightly year-on-year. Distribution of employees by technology While digital technology attracts an abundance of talent to the Indian VLSI industry, companies are moving up the value chain, which is evident in increased availability of talent in the analog and mixed signals space. Analog designs are becoming more intuitive and come with quite a few years of experience. These designs cannot be automated as easily as digital signals, making tools of little or no use. The crucial point is the requirement for specific analog-related skill-sets, which are still scarce, and the availability of talent does not meet the requirements. On the other hand, data converters and wireless networks are driving the demand for mixed signal engineers.

The key drivers of the country’s VLSI design industry include: i. Rising demand for electronic products worldwide The increase in the global demand for electronic products, particularly consumer electronics and computer hardware, and the need for enhanced functionality in electronic products is creating a strong demand for product innovation. This global demand is creating an industry for design services in India. ii. Increasing maturity of the Indian design ecosystem With the presence of the top 25 semiconductor companies and 10 fab-less companies in India, more complex work, in terms of current technology nodes, is being carried out in Indian centers. Companies that have been in existence for more than 10 years in the country are slowly moving toward complete engineering ownership (including end-customer support), which has been one the key factors driving maturity in the VLSI segmentExhibit 43: Increasing demand for electronic products globally, USD billions, 2009-2020 Source: EY report on electronics systems design and manufacturing ecosystem, 20092.9%USD millions 1,750 2,000 2,400 2009 2014 2020 Global industry size Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry50 Challenges Though there are signs that indicate a positive outlook for the VLSI design industry in India, there a few challenges which hinder its progress, among which a few need to be addressed soon. i. Lack of scale at leading node With technology transforming at a rapid pace (Moore’s Law), India’s deficit of relevant talent is increasing. Although expertise does exist in handling geometries of 45nm or 32nm, there is an absence of scale, with most of the engineers in India handling geometries of 65nm and 90nm. Design and validation of complex system on chips (SoCs) and getting the silicon to work the first time is the biggest challenge. Furthermore, verification or validation of such complex systems is one of the biggest challenges, which requires the use of methodologies such as OVM, VMM and UVM. ii. Lack of R&D funding in universities Universities in mature markets such as in the US or in Europe work on cutting edge chip technologies and design, which materialize into products a few years later. But this phenomenon is absent in India, which leads to fresh talent not being readily deployable and requiring a lead time to come to speed. Challenges present themselves in inadequate research infrastructure facilities to facilitate research toward device shrinkage beyond 45/32nm semiconductor process technology. 51 Section 1: Industry analysis Embedded software industry Embedded software is any computer software which plays an integral role in the electronics with which it is supplied. It can be any code, which interacts with the hardware layer, ranging from the hardware abstraction layer, device drivers, kernel programming to application programming. The total embedded software industry in India was estimated at US$ 5.3 billion in 2009 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% to reach US$8.6 billion in 2012. This industry accounts for the bulk of semiconductor design activities in India, with a share of 80% in the Indian semiconductor design industry’s revenues. The industry estimate of the fully-loaded cost per FTE per month is US$ 3,656 and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.7% to reach close to US$ 4,000 in 2012. This growth can be attributed to the embedded software industry tiding over the recession and third-party service providers recruiting in bulk.V.

The embedded software industry is expanding as third-party service providers are moving up the value chain to offer more high-value activities relating to middleware, driver design and associated applications. Captives largely work on the hardware abstraction layer and the device driver layer. While many captives outsource application-related work to third-party service providers and Indian design companies to shorten their time-to-market, others prefer to grow their domain- specific embedded application expertise in-house. Other reasons for increased adoption of embedded software is its utilization by electronic companies in the face of immense pressure for innovation from end customers in terms of increased functionality, reduced time-to-market and reduction in costs.

Telephones and handheld devices in the telecom segment and home multimedia and security systems in the consumer electronics segments are driving growth in the industry. While Indian vendors have been growing in these verticals, players have begun building competencies around new verticals such as automobile, healthcare and storage, and the automobile sector is expected to grow considerably over the next two years.

The projects in >10 layers are mostly related to telecom/network gigabit ethernet switches. Breakup by educational qualifications Although the segment draws heavily from engineering graduates, the concentration of the workforce with Master’s degrees is relatively lower than in the VLSI segment. This could be due to the large requirement for fresh talent, year-on-year, by this industry.Exhibit 48: Embedded software design industry workforce in India, 2009-12 (in ‘000s) Source: ISA111 131157192 2009 2010 2011 201220% Exhibit 49: Embedded software industry headcount split by educational qualification, 2009 Source: ISA—EY research 2010Bachelors in technology 78%Masters degree 19% Ph.D 1% Diploma holders 1% Others 1% 55 Section 1: Industry analysis Experience-wise and diversity ratio distribution of employees Due to the nature of the job profile being similar to software development, this segment employs a higher number of freshers out of college, as compared to the VLSI industry. It has not seen any significant change in the ratio of women to men employed in the industry, as compared to 2007 levels. Distribution of employees by activity The segment draws heavily from engineering graduates, although this industry employs a larger number of diploma degree holders as compared to the other two segments. The presence of a large number of diploma holders helps to maintain lower average fully-loaded cost per FTE in the industry.Exhibit 50: Embedded software design industry headcount split by experience, 2009 Source: ISA8 years 28%Exhibit 51: Embedded software design industry split by gender, 2009 Source: ISA—EY research 2010Male 80%Female 20% Exhibit 52: Embedded software headcount split by activity, 2009 Source: ISA—EY research 2010Chip level programming 16% OS related programming 18% Middleware/ embedded applications 25%Testing 23%Protocol development 17% Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry56 Embedded software industry drivers and challenges Drivers i. Product customization due to localization The growing consumer market is creating a need for localized product features, resulting in increasing activity in the embedded software development domain, especially in the consumer electronics, defense, telecom and automotives segments. ii. Greater requirement for flexibility and functionality Growing affluence is redefining lifestyle aspirations, influenced by growing self- confidence, expanding consumerism, increased spending power and greater access to lifestyle goods and services, e.g., in the field of automobiles, embedded software being used in features such as power steering and windows. iii. Legislative requirements Country specific legislations, such as Bharat Stage -IV norms, require customization of certain features/functionality. Other instances are in the field of green energy (emission control), safety innovations (anti-lock brakes and air bags), etc. iv. Increasing capability of third-party service providers and Indian design companies The increasing capability of third-party service providers and Indian design companies, which are moving up the value chain to offer high-value activities relating to middleware and OS programming, is driving the expansion of the embedded software industry in India. v. Lower entry barrier for service providers Embedded software development does not require costly tools and solutions such as EDA, and the presence of a large talent pool has resulted in the establishment of a large number of small and niche service providers in this space. vi. Adaption of open-source platforms With chip design companies adapting open-source platforms such as Linux and Google’s Android, there is an increased amount of embedded software required to support a chip’s functionality, in which has given a boost to the embedded software industry 57 Section 1: Industry analysis Challenges i. Cost pressures due to constantly evolving platforms One of the key challenges in the embedded software industry is to keep pace with the current technology node, which changes every 18–24 months, while providing increased functionality at the same or lower cost. ii. Integration and testing of software and hardware Semiconductor design companies face issues relating to integration and testing of software procured from IP providers. Although many captives have invested in home- grown integration and testing platforms or frameworks, this increases cost pressures on IP developers and causes performance issues with the integration of multiple IPs. No standard methodology is evolving, even with the use of various traditional methods such as co-simulation, simulation acceleration, emulation, and FPGA testing. iii. Skill-set availability of high-end programmers Multiple embedded processors in SoCs / MCUs with independent functions are being adopted in electronic devices due to higher power consumption from single core processors. Building these reliable and high-performance systems requires parallel software development, called symmetric multi processing, which is leading to an increased requirement of expert parallel programmers. There are also challenges in finding software programmers, who can balance power and tight optimization in limited hardware memory. iv. Preference for ADM services as a career option In terms of complexity, embedded programmers have to work within a limited memory that comes with the hardware, balance power, cost, size and simplicity of the design. However, even in the case of those with these complex skill-sets, Application, Development and Maintenance (ADM) services are perceived as an uncomplicated career option. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry58 The hardware/board design Industry in India was estimated at around US $ 417 million in 2009 and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 17.3% to reach US$ 672 million in 2012. This industry is the smallest segment in the Indian semiconductor design industry, accounting for only 6.3% of the design industry’s revenues. Its growth can be attributed to captives concentrating on pure-play VLSI activities and preferring to outsource reference and new board design activities to third-party service providers and to set up home-grown companies that only concentrate on board/hardware design activities. The industry estimate for the average fully loaded cost per FTE per month is US$ 3,240 and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.7% to reach US$ 3,506 in 2012. These rates are comparatively lower than that commanded by the embedded software industry and considerably lower than the VLSI design industry’s. One reason could be the presence of a larger percentage of diploma holders in the industry, as is seen later in Exhibit 78, which helps to bring down the average fully-loaded cost per FTE.Board/hardware design industryVI. 672Exhibit 53: Hardware/board design industry in India by revenues, 2009-12 Source: ISA417476558 0100200300400500600700800 2009 2010 2011 2012USD millions17.3% Exhibit 54: Hardware/board design industry – average blended and fully-loaded cost per FTE per month, 2009–2012 Source: ISA2.7% 3240333734373506 3,1003,1503,2003,2503,3003,3503,4003,4503,5003,550 2009 2010 2011 2012US D 59 Section 1: Industry analysis This segment broadly consists of the following categories: • Reference board design • New board design • Board design derivatives and modifications on existing boards Most captives only make reference boards that are used to validate the capabilities of silicon chips designed in-house. Captives are not yet providing reference board designs as a service to other companies. Some captives are outsourcing reference board design work to third-party service providers and Indian design companies, in which the schematic layout is designed by the captives and the rest of the activities are outsourced, which decreases the time-to-market of the chip. These service providers have a significant presence in the new and derivative board design space for product development companies There is significant opportunity for hardware/ board design services in India. Some of the factors contributing to this include: • As compared to the VLSI segment, proximity to local/ end-use markets has a pronounced effect on hardware/ board design, since customer requirements and local nuances need to be considered. With most global electronic product majors focusing on creating emerging market-specific products, this leads to significant traction in the segment • Indian service providers are taking strong IP measures to drive India’s USP, as compared to competition from countries such as China and Taiwan. Some of the measures undertaken include: • Conducting IP protection sessions regularly for all employees to reinforce IP protection principles • Conducting IP audits for every project to ensure that no open source codecs or other companies code is used • Providing cool-off period for designers before they work on a competitor customer product Hardware/board design flow In terms of design-related activities, captives are collaborating with third-party service providers during the chip design stage. This is due to their increased confidence on Indian board designers and their competence in the areas of IP development and integration.

Key consuming industry segments and demand evolution of hardware/board design Consumer electronics, telecom/ networking products and portable wireless are the key growth contributors to the hardware/ board design industry. With India-specific products emerging as a major consumer segment for these product categories, the demand for hardware/ board design in India is pronounced.

This growth in the workforce is primarily driven by increasing business volumes generated by third-party service providers from captive centers as well as VLSI design captives offering hardware/ board design services to the parent company. However, the key challenge the country’s workforce faces is the inadequate supply of qualified design engineers, who are capable of handling ever-increasing board design complexity. Breakup by educational qualifications The segment draws heavily from engineering graduates, although this industry employs a larger number of diploma degree holders as compared to the other two segments. The presence of a large number of diploma holders helps to maintain lower average fully-loaded cost per FTE in the industry.Exhibit 59: Hardware/board design industry workforce in India, 2009-12 (‘00s) Source: ISA98 116 139 170 2009 2010 2011 201220% Exhibit 60: Hardware/board design industry headcount split by educational qualification, 2009 Source: ISA—EY research 2010Bachelors in technology 77%Masters degree 15% Diploma holders 4% Others 2% 63 Section 1: Industry analysis Experience-wise and diversity ratio distribution of employees This segment employs the maximum workforce with above three years of work experience.

Hardware/Board design industry: drivers and challenges Drivers i. Emergence of India as a consumer market The rising discretionary spending of consumers has positively affected the consumer electronics and automobile segments, creating new opportunities in India, as is the trend seen in more mature markets.Exhibit 61: Board/hardware design industry headcount split by experience, 2009 Source: ISA8 years 30%Exhibit 62: Board/hardware design industry split by gender, 2009 Source: ISA—EY research 2010Male 84%Female 16% Exhibit 63: Increasing demand for electronic products in India, 2009-2020 Source: EY report on electronics systems design and manufacturing ecosystem, 200945125400 1685320 -100 200 300 400 500 2009 2014 2020USD billions Domestic electronics demand Production for domestic consumption 22%31% Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry64 ii. Increased outsourcing by OEMs and emergence of EMS companies India is beginning to mirror the global trend in terms of EMS companies gaining popularity and setting up their captive design centers to support their global and APAC customers and also tap into the local market opportunity. OEMs are also increasingly outsourcing their system designs to Indian design companies. iii. Product localization An increasing number of companies are re-engineering their products to suit domestic market requirements to lower costs, enhance functionality and provide a competitive advantage over other products, especially in the market for mobile telephony, consumer products, automotives, indigenized defense and avionics. iv. Re-engineering opportunities Multiple re-engineering opportunities are available within the Indian ecosystem to provide benefits such as reduced system costs, effective risk management and prevention of health hazards. • Augmenting existing designs with additional features • Obsolescence – frequent changes in semiconductor components (Moore’s law) and other re-design related changes such as changing power designs, more mobile and portable systems and reducing capacity loads • Compliance – changing environmental legislation, giving rise to RoHS and WEEE laws and regulations with which to comply v. Captives partnering third-party service providers Captives are exploring various possibilities of partnering with third-party service providers. Some of these include the following: • The introduction of early access programs to design reference boards and verification platforms in parallel with chip design to reduce time-to-market • Chip usage promotion during board/ hardware design • Setting up design labs in campuses of third-party service providers to increase marketability of captive products, thereby bringing in more work to the segment 65 Section 1: Industry analysis Challenges i. Compliance-related challenges Lab testing and certification services are offered by a few companies in India and issues arise in the following: • Potential delay in products reaching the market due to the time required for certification • Timely availability of testing slots Having in-house certification labs is not feasible due to the vast number of certifications as well as the expense factor in setting up such labs. Another challenge is the absence of standardized frameworks for pre-qualification testing in-house to save time and reduce the number of design iterations. There is also the absence of a testing equipment ecosystem for rent, unlike that available in Taiwan and China ii. Lack of component ecosystem development Unavailability of component-manufacturing setups in India, especially of type C components, leads to: • Delays in sourcing components at the required time • Excess buildup of inventories due to placement of minimum order quantity orders only There is a need for either electronics system-manufacturing companies setting up shop in India or the component supply chain strengthening. iii. Adoption of de-risking business models by customers Product companies are seeking longer warranty periods and engaging design teams in a joint ownership model, thereby ensuring that they work as partners to share risks by incorporating sufficient input received from adequate pilot runs and field tests into the design cycle, to produce a better, complete and successful product. iv. Official policies • ►Movement of hardware products/goods between STPI units and SEZs as well as different STPIs Is not permissible by the law today, causing inconvenience to companies, which are a part of these units and have a presence in STPIs and SEZs. • Import procedures are time-consuming and there is a dire need to streamline them, especially in the area of classification of items Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry66 Annexure Annexure I: EDA tools industry Global EDA industry overview The global electronic design automation industry has been hit hard by the recession, primarily due to the falling demand for electronic products resulting in reduced sales of semiconductor devices. The global EDA industry witnessed a decline of 8% from US$ 3.5 billion in 2008 to US$ 3.2 billion in 2009. As the economic situation stabilizes and brings back electronic products and semiconductor consumption levels to normalcy, the industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% to reach US$ 4.1 billion in 2014. Most of the end-markets for semiconductor devices continue to be highly competitive and use design as an enabler to achieve cost reduction and product differentiation through feature enhancement. Going forward, this is expected to be the key driver to aid the growth of the EDA industry.

The development of such products requires diverse skill- sets spanning electronics and electrical engineering, computer science and programming, and advanced mathematics. India has traditionally been very attractive to global EDA for product development due to the country’s high graduate turnout in relevant fields. There are an increasing number of companies operating in the semiconductor design space, both captives and non-captives (including India-based semiconductor product companies). These companies are moving up the value chain to take up higher complexity design work, which creates a huge demand for EDA tool usage. It is quite impossible to estimate the revenues of individual countries, where a large number of captive centers are located, since license sale happens at their headquarters and these licenses are utilized in unique ways across time zones to optimize costs. Drivers of the Indian EDA industry i. Rapidly evolving semiconductor design ecosystem in India Companies operating in the semiconductor design space in India are moving up the value chain to take up higher complexity projects and are operating in an engineering product ownership mode, which is resulting in increased design services being performed in India. This is driving increased EDA tool license sales in India. ii. Increasing design complexity Decreasing technology nodes and an increasing number of architectural decisions, driven by Indian design centers, are creating a strong need for the adoption of additional EDA tools, to keep up with the rapid pace of the semiconductor industry. iii. Strategic acquisitions by Indian design services companies Indian design services companies have acquired captive design centers to enhance their design service offerings, which emphasizes their commitment to the Indian semiconductor scenario and is an indication of the burgeoning growth of this industry in the country, e.g.,, MindTree’s acquisition of TES PV. Challenges for the Indian EDA industry The EDA companies operating in India do not face any India-specific challenges, since there are no India- specific EDA tools or chips designs. The majority of the challenges faced by EDA companies are technical, and are caused due to rapid advancement in chip and chip- manufacturing technologies. The rapid innovation cycles of semiconductor companies force EDA companies to develop new products to keep pace with market requirements, e.g., low power (from the system level through physical layout), functional verification challenges and manufacturing variability (through the application of design-for-manufacturing techniques to design). Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry68 Licensing models i. Perpetual license model This is the more traditional model, which is seldom used. The license, once procured for this model, is typically effective for 99 years. Maintenance, which includes technical support, product updates, bug fixes, etc., is typically purchased separately on a year-on- year basis and is typically around 10 –15% of the perpetual license cost. ii. Term -based models Term-based models allow the lease of the EDA tool license for a fixed duration (in weeks/ months/ years) and typically includes maintenance. This is the model preferred by most companies engaging in semiconductor design in India as it offers flexibility on a client- to-client and a project-to-project basis. The annual pricing of a time-based license is generally around 20 –40% of the price of the perpetual license. a. Captives The captive centers of global companies typically use a global pool of licenses hosted in one or more locations, which can be accessed by their employees worldwide across time zones. These allow the flexibility of one license being utilized by more than one designer in a complimentary time zone. Less than 5% of the captive centers have opted for a site-specific/ India-specific license. A global license typically costs more than a site-specific one due to the flexibility it offers.

Third-party service providers In the case of third-party service providers, who have fixed delivery centers across the world, the site-specific license is the preferred model (c. 80–90%) over a global one. However, utilization of the license depends on the customer’s budget and infrastructure. In the case of small customer budgets, service providers use their own licenses. In the case of a larger customer budgets, third-party service providers typically use the customers’ licenses, either onsite or offsite for client servicing. iii. Cloud-based licenses None of the companies currently offer this type of a delivery model, in which the purchaser is charged on a pay-per-use basis. However, this is slated to be the a key trend in the industry as it opens up opportunities for EDA tool vendors to tap into a larger section of the market, which cannot afford to pay huge upfront license costs. EDA tool-buying behavior The purchase of an EDA tool depends on a multitude of factors including costs, capabilities, features, the maturity of the team that will be using it, etc. Based on discussions with industry players, companies head- quartered in the Americas have typically preferred a global pool of licenses, as compared to companies in Europe that have site-specific license allocation for specific projects/ products. The maturity and capability of the global design center of an MNC firm typically defines the types of EDA tools and license models. The head of a relatively mature design center (implying local engineering ownership and governance) has a significant say in purchase decisions related to that center, as compared to a newly established center, which is globally governed and monitored. Companies with lower EDA budgets have limited themselves to a single EDA tool across their organizations, but those with larger budgets typically use a diverse set of tools from multiple tool vendors for various applications in their global location. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry70 Annexure II: definitions Captive unit A captive unit is a company that develops a total product or a module, which it brands and markets as part of its (own) product development. The India unit carries out the work for the global organization. Non-captive unit This is a unit that provides third-party services/ IP design and development services in the areas of interest mentioned below for a fee, and the activity undertaken is not for its own use. Revenue The year 2009 was taken as the base year for estimating revenues for this study. Service The service includes VLSI design, hardware/ board design and embedded software development offered by captive and non- captive companies. Average blended and fully-loaded cost per FTE per month The average fully-loaded cost per FTE per month is the simple average of the per month per engineer rate, which includes other elements of the costs to the company, such as the facility, administration and other infrastructure-related costs of VLSI, hardware/ board design and embedded software development activity in the semiconductor and embedded design industry in India. Hence, this is different from the average salary drawn per FTE. However, it excludes EDA tools license costs. VLSI design VLSI circuit design refers to technology by which it is possible to design and implement large circuits on silicon. These circuits have more than one million transistors. VLSI technology has been successfully used to build microprocessors, signal processors, systolic arrays, large capacity memories, memory controllers, I/O controllers and inter connection networks. Revenue from VLSI The base year for which revenue estimates for the VLSI industry are provided is 2009.

Summary 122 Annexure 123 Definitions 123 References 124 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry76 The benchmarking study: overviewI. The objective of this benchmarking study is to explain the current state of the Indian semiconductor design sector and overall business environment. The study explains various parameters that are important for the development of a country’s semiconductor design sector. Quantitative benchmarking for India has been done on these parameters vis-à-vis other countries, which are considered pioneers of semiconductor design. The countries selected for this study constitute a representative sample of semiconductor design activity. India’s benchmarking has been done with the following countries: • ► The US • ► The UK • ► Germany • ► Sweden • ► China • ► Taiwan • ► Israel We conducted the study through publicly available secondary sources. Other countries such as Japan and South Korea, which are considered pioneers in semiconductor design, were not included in the sample set because of associated difficulties in obtaining information from public sources due to language constraints. The parameters for this study are industry dynamics, talent pool, innovation environment, operating costs, infrastructure and quality of the business environment. The section on industry dynamics consists of parameters that explain the development of the semiconductor ecosystem in a country. It comprises a number of design houses, electronics production, design industry revenues and the geographic concentration or fragmentation of the industry. 77 Section 2: Benchmarking Semiconductor design requires a highly skilled labor force. The talent pool section focuses on the number of engineers currently working in the semiconductor design sector and the annual addition of engineers qualified in disciplines relevant to the semiconductor design sector. The number of engineering colleges covered in this section is an indicator of the future scalability of talent. The design sector involves a high degree of creation of IP. The innovation environment deals with the innovation capabilities of a country as a whole. The comparison on innovation environment has been made based on the quality of scientific research institutes and spending on R&D by companies. Countries have also been benchmarked on the number of IEEE papers filed from the country for disciplines relevant for semiconductor industry. Operating cost is an important parameter, as it impacts the overall profitability of running a business in a country. The major costs of operating in a country include manpower cost, office space rentals, electricity cost, interest cost and travel cost. High costs reduce profitability and, therefore, companies do not consider countries with high operational costs to be favorable business destinations. The quality of physical infrastructure available in a country is a major factor that attracts new players, both domestic and foreign, for business. The study focuses on comparing countries on the basis of communication infrastructure, the availability of high-quality Grade A office space and the power demand-supply scenario. The section on the quality of business environment describes parameters that depict the ease of doing business in a country. A country’s business environment is measured by the complexity involved in starting a new business in terms of number of procedures and taxation rates. Prevalence of an efficient legal framework is important for the protection of IP rights for that country’s semiconductor design industry. Efficiency of legal framework in challenging regulations has been used as benchmarking parameter to study the legal environment in a country.

Industry revenues Industry revenues reflect the level of semiconductor design activity taking place in a particular country. The numbers for revenues have been estimated using the number of design engineers working in a particular country, fully loaded cost (including tools and infrastructure) per full-time employee (FTE) and profit margin. Exhibit 3 compares the countries on the value of semiconductor design industry revenues in 2009. Key observations • Among the sample set of countries, the US has the highest semiconductor design revenues. • With design revenues of US$1.23 billion, Israel ranks last among the sample set of countries. • India ranks second among the sample set of countries, with revenues of US$6.6 billion. Takeaways for India • Since the US leads the sample set in terms of number of design engineers and average salary cost of an FTE, design revenues in the US are the highest. Benchmarking on the number of design engineers has been done in Chapter 2.a., while salary cost has been benchmarked in Chapter 4.c. • Based on the steady increase in the number of design engineers in India in the past few years, design revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% until 2012.Exhibit 3: Semiconductor design industry revenues *Data not available for GermanySource: Multiple; refer references on page 1240.002.004.006.008.0010.0012.00 44.9 US UK Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaIndustry revenues (in US$ billion) 81 Section 2: Benchmarking 1.b. Quantum of electronics production Semiconductors constitute an integral part of electronic products. Therefore, a high amount of electronics production boosts growth in a country’s semiconductor industry. Exhibit 4 compares countries on the value of electronics production in 2009. Key observations • China leads the sample set of countries in terms of value of electronics components and equipment manufactured with revenues of more than US$411.7 billion from electronics production. • Sweden has the lowest value of annual electronics production in the sample set, at approximately US$7.5 billion. • Electronics production in India was valued at US$20.3 billion in 2009, and ranks sixth among sample set countries on this parameter. • ► While India is ahead of Sweden and Israel, it lags behind China, the US, Germany, Taiwan and the UK.Exhibit 4: Quantum of electronics production 0102030405060708090100 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaElectronics production (in US$ billion)411.7 240.4 Source: Multiple; refer references on page 124 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry82 The Indian electronics industry The demand for electronics in the Indian market stood at US$45 billion in 2009 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 22% to reach US$125 billion by 2014 and to US$400 billion by 2020. India meets a large portion of its domestic demand of electronics items through imports from countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea and Malaysia. Exports, which constituted a small portion (approximately 21%) of production in 2009, are expected to increase from US$4.4 billion in 2009 to US$15 billion by 2014 and US$80 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of approximately 31%. Growth in per-capita income has been a major trend driving this market. Nearly 10 million households are estimated to have income levels above US$10,000 per annum. With an annual growth rate of 20%, this household segment offers opportunities for electronics products. The rising Indian middle class has generated more demand for mobile handsets, televisions, retail, and automotive and other consumer electronics products. Electronics production between 2005 and 2009 grew at a CAGR of approximately 17%. At this rate, electronics production is expected to increase to US$114 billion in 2020. This, in turn, is likely to lead to a significant increase in the demand-supply gap, which will rise to US$286 billion in 2020. Therefore, it is essential to increase the pace of growth. The targeted growth rate in electronics production is around 31% annually between 2009 and 2020 and is expected to reach a value of US$400 billion. Of this, while US$80 billion is expected to be exported, US$320 billion will meet domestic demand. Takeaways for India • The rapidly growing electronics market is likely to serve as an important growth driver for the Indian semiconductor industry. • Despite the rising demand for electronics in India, certain challenges tend to lead to a significant demand-supply gap. Exhibit 5: Factors resulting in relatively low electronics production High and unstable corporate tax rate Inadequate infrastructure Constraints in supply chain and logistics Lack of funds for R&D Inflexible labor laws Limited focus on electronics exportsDemand — s upply mismatch 83 Section 2: Benchmarking • ► India’s corporate taxation rate is higher than that of the sample set of countries, which makes the final product less competitive than low-cost destinations such as China and Taiwan. Tax-rate benchmarking of all sample countries has been done in Chapter 6.b. • ► The GoI also needs to ramp up infrastructure development in the country. Chapter 5 of this report details the benchmarking of several infrastructure-related parameters. • ► Supply chain and logistics constraints, inflexible labor laws and limited focus on exports are others issues that need to be addressed to boost electronics manufacturing in the country. • ► India is one of the leaders among the sample set of countries in producing engineers equipped with the requisite skills for electronics production. The country’s abundant talent pool and resources can be utilized to produce high-value products; thus, domestic value addition may be encouraged and incentivized. Talent-pool benchmarking has been detailed in Chapter 2. • ► The GoI should encourage products specifically designed for India. The developmental sector can benefit from biometric readers, smart meters, micro-payment devices, and low-cost medical devices. • ► Improvements in these factors are likely to help local manufacturers compete with the prices of imported finished goods. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry84 1.c. Semiconductor design companies The number of fabless semiconductor design units is a direct indicator of a semiconductor design sector’s maturity in any given country. Exhibit 6 depicts the number of semiconductor design units in various countries. Key observations • ► The US leads the sample set with the highest number of design units. The country has 507 design units. • ► China is a close second with 472 design units. • ► India ranks fifth among the sample set countries, with around 120 design units in operation. Takeaways for India • ► Taiwan, which has adopted a cluster-based approach, is home to more design companies than India, as it has a well-developed semiconductor ecosystem with fabrication, assembly testing and packaging (ATP) units, along with design units. The section on geographic concentration or fragmentation of the semiconductor industry discusses semiconductor clusters in the sample set of countries. • ► Several global integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) have set up captive design centers in India in the past decade. Several IDMs have also started outsourcing projects to third- party design houses in India. This has led to the establishment of a large number of independent design houses in India in the past decade. • ► India needs to encourage the establishment of fabrication units and ATP companies, since the development of an entire semiconductor ecosystem may also give an impetus to the establishment of design units in the country. Exhibit 6: Semiconductor design companies US 507Taiwan 256 India 120Israel 150Sweden 80Germany 39 UK 110 China 472 Source: Multiple; refer references on page 124 85 Section 2: Benchmarking 1.d. Geographic concentration/fragmentation of design industry Geographic concentration/fragmentation is an indicator of how semiconductor design activities across the country are distributed. High fragmentation implies that design centers are dispersed throughout the country. A cluster-based approach tends to be more successful, as it focuses on linkages and interdependence between companies while producing products and services and creating innovations. Cluster formation captures interdependencies as well as economies of scale and scope. It reduces transaction costs, results in the development of new skills and speeds up learning processes. Some countries in the sample set have well-defined semiconductor clusters, which include integrated circuit (IC) design companies, fabrication units, and packaging and testing companies, all under one roof. This allows for competition as well as cooperation and integration, which facilitate the overall development of the industry. Exhibit 7 lists the regions where the majority of semiconductor design activity in each country is conducted. Country Semiconductor design activity in cities/clusters India The majority of semiconductor design centers are spread across Bengaluru, the National Capital Region (NCR), Hyderabad and Pune. China China has more than 100 “high-technology parks” scattered throughout the country. Relatively large and more concentrated clusters are emerging in Zhangjiang, Suzhou and Beijing. Taiwan The country’s semiconductor cluster is located in Hsinchu Science Park near Taipei. Nankang Software Park also has an IC design park. UK Several fabless semiconductor players, especially start-ups, have a presence in Southwest England — Bristol, Bath, Plymouth and Gloucester. Oxford, Southampton and Surrey in Southeast England are focused on application engineering and hardware design in the semiconductor ecosystem. Cambridge in East England has a healthy number of semiconductor design companies focused on device- and application-based markets. Sweden Stockholm, Lund, Göteborg and Linköping are four clusters in Sweden with the highest concentration of the semiconductor industry. US Semiconductor clusters in the US are located in Silicon Valley, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Israel Semiconductor design units can be found in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Herzliya, Migdal Ha’emek, Holon, Beer Sheva and Dimona. Germany Semiconductor clusters in Germany are located in Dresden, Dortmund, Munich, Berlin and Hamburg. Source: Multiple; refer references on page 124 Exhibit 7 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry86 Case study: the Cambridge cluster “Silicon Fen,” as the cluster is popularly known as, is located in the Cambridge region in East England. High-technology companies engaged in electronics and software have a strong presence in this cluster. Silicon Fen has several semiconductor design companies that focus on device- and application-based markets. The cluster came into existence in 1970s, when a large number of high-technology spin-offs from the University of Cambridge established businesses to meet the growing international demand for high-tech output. In the 1980s, this cluster produced more patents per capita than the UK average. Subsequently, the cluster grew rapidly along with the emergence of computer services firms and companies involved in R&D. Its proximity to the University of Cambridge has been cited as the prime reason behind its development. The university is a major source of highly skilled and qualified manpower. The availability of competitive manpower addresses the need of the semiconductor sector, which is highly knowledge-intensive. High-technology companies located in the cluster collaborate with related departments at the University of Cambridge for R&D activities by setting up research laboratories on campus. Easy access to finance is another important factor. Venture capital firms and local intermediaries provide financial assistance to firms situated in the cluster. The university remains a breeding ground for several technology start-ups, which set up their operations in the cluster. A combination of all these reasons has led to the formation of a well-established semiconductor industry in this part of the UK. Takeaways for India • India can learn from China and Taiwan, where the respective governments have promoted the formation of a semiconductor ecosystem through a cluster-based approach. This has led to the rapid development of captive and independent design centers in these countries, due to which they are ahead of India in terms of number of design units. • The GoI needs to take steps to develop fabrication and ATP units in the country. The creation of clusters hosting the entire value chain of the semiconductor sector needs to be promoted in order to facilitate consolidation and overall industry development. 87 Section 2: Benchmarking Industry dynamics: summary The Indian semiconductor design sector is fairly developed, with around 120 design units. The country is ranked second among the sample set of countries in terms of design revenues. Several global integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) have set up captive design centers in India in the past decade. Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and the NCR collectively account for the majority of semiconductor design activity in India. India can give further impetus to this industry by drawing from industry experience in Taiwan and China, countries that have adopted a cluster-based approach and developed a mature semiconductor ecosystem with fabrication and ATP units to complement design units. The rapidly growing electronics market in India has resulted in increased demand for semiconductor components. As such, the electronics industry is expected to serve as one of the primary growth drivers of the country’s semiconductor industry in future.

Research and development Companies need to design and develop innovative products and processes to create and sustain competitive advantage. This requires investment in R&D and collaboration between universities and the industry for research. The presence of high-quality research institutes facilitates R&D activity in a country by making available the requisite resources for the development of new technologies. The benchmarking of countries to indicate their research and development environment has been done on the following parameters: • ► Quality of scientific research institutions • ► Company spending on R&D Exhibit 13 depicts the rankings of the countries on the parameters mentioned above. A high ranking on the quality of scientific research institutions parameter indicates that the institutes are regarded as best in their category internationally. The countries where companies spend more money on R&D activities are ranked higher than others in the sample set. Key observations Quality of scientific research institutes: • Israel is the best-ranked country in the sample set as well as globally in terms of quality of scientific research institutes. • China, with a global rank of 39, ranks last among the sample set of countries. • India, with a global rank of 30, ranks seventh in the sample set.Exhibit 13: Global rankings on research and development environment parameters 051015202530354045 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaGlobal rankings Quality of scientific research institutions Company spending on R&D Source: Multiple; refer references on page 126 95 Section 2: Benchmarking Company spending on R&D: • Sweden ranks the highest among the sample set of countries as well as globally in terms of company spending on R&D. • India, with a global rank of 37, ranks last among the sample set of countries. Takeaways for India • India provides companies with a favorable environment in which to set up R&D facilities. Global MNCs such as General Electric (GE) have established their research centers in the country. GE’s John F Welch Technology Centre, which was established in Bengaluru in 2000, is one of the company’s first R&D facilities outside the US. Since its operational inception, the center has filed around 180 patents. • Leading companies in the semiconductor industry have also set up their captive centers in the country to conduct R&D activities. The number of patents filed by India operations of companies such as Texas Instruments (TI), ST Microelectronics (STM), Intel and Broadcom Corporation between 2005 and 2009 is 181, 120, 54 and 51, respectively. • The R&D talent pool of MNCs in India has also seen rapid growth in the past decade. The number of MNC employees working at their respective R&D centers in India has increased from 16,000 in 2000 to 180,000 in 2009, growing at a CAGR of 30.9%. This number is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% to reach 319,000 in 2015. On the other hand, China also had approximately 16,000 MNC personnel employed at R&D centers in 2000. This has increased to 130,000 in 2009, growing at a CAGR of approximately 26%. Thus, India is ahead of China in terms of the R&D initiatives that MNCs in the countries are adopting. • India lags behind other countries in the sample set in terms of company spending on R&D activities. Although the GoI provides certain tax exemptions on R&D expenditure by companies, it needs to provide more incentives to encourage companies to spend more on R&D. • India also needs to improve the quality of research institutions in order to remain an attractive destination for MNCs wanting to conduct R&D activities in the country. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry96 3.b. Number of IEEE papers submitted The number of IEEE papers submitted reflects the country’s ability to conduct research and innovate new designs for the semiconductor industry. High number of IEEE papers filed from a country indicates a greater level of involvement in innovation activities. Exhibit 14 compares the sample set of countries on the basis of the number of IEEE papers filed from a country. The statistics on IEEE papers are sourced from the IEEE societies of computer, software, design and test of computers, transaction on computers and software engineering. Key observations • ► The US ranks first on this parameter with the highest number of IEEE papers submitted for 2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively. • ► Number of IEEE papers filed from Sweden is 7, 9 and 10 for 2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively. The country ranks last on this parameter. • ► In India, the number of IEEE papers is 57, 84 and 95 for 2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively. In terms of 2009 rankings among sample set countries, India is ranked third after the US and China. Takeaways for India • ► The number of papers submitted from India has grown from 57 in 2005 to 95 in 2009, indicating an absolute growth rate of 66.6% in four years. India is ranked higher than all the other countries except Taiwan in terms of this growth rate. • ► India’s share in terms of world submission of IEEE papers has also increased from 4.9% in 2005 to 6% in 2009 indicating a higher level of research activities being carried out in the country. • ► Although the above figures indicate the submission of IEEE papers, India needs to improve the acceptance rates of papers submitted. In 2010, acceptance rate of India’s papers was 4.5%, which is very low as compared to countries such as the US, the UK and Germany, which have acceptance rates of 37.6%, 34.2% and 21.7%, respectively. This indicates a relative lack of quality in research work carried out in India. Exhibit 14: Number of IEEE papers submitted 020406080100120140160180200420,516,403 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaIEEE papers submitted 2005 2007 2009 Source: IEEE 97 Section 2: Benchmarking Innovation environment: summary The innovation environment in India is evolving rapidly, and the country is becoming one of the prime destinations for companies seeking to establish R&D centers outside their home country. India’s availability of skilled talent and high-quality scientific research institutes are primary reasons for its growing reputation as an attractive country for the establishment of R&D centers. A number of Indian captives of global semiconductor companies file patents every year, which indicates the level of IP being created. The country also ranks favorably in terms of the number of IEEE papers filed from the country in the fields relevant for semiconductor design. Since India lags behind other countries in the sample set in terms of company spending on R&D, the GoI needs to provide more incentives to encourage R&D activity in India. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry98 4. Operating costs This chapter focuses on the fourth benchmarking parameter — operating costs. Operating costs for semiconductor design units include salaries of semiconductor design professionals, electricity costs, office space rent, the cost of bandwidth and design tools, and miscellaneous expenses. For the purpose of this benchmarking study, the cost of design tools has not been taken into account, since it is almost standard across the globe for a given multinational semiconductor company. This is because companies purchase global licenses for tools, which can be used by their design centers in different time zones. The benchmarking parameters analyzed in this category are: • Average annual rentals of office space • Average cost of electricity • Average annual salary of semiconductor design personnel • Cost of raising debt • ► Travel costs Information on office space rentals has been collected using research reports published by global real estate consulting majors such as Jones Lang Lasalle and CB Richard Ellis. The majority of the data on electricity tariffs has been collected from websites of government energy departments and statistical databases of countries in the sample set. Data on prime lending rates for most of the countries has been obtained from the websites of central banks of the respective countries.Exhibit 15 Benchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Annual average office space rentals The amount of rent that companies pay for office space constitutes a major chunk of companies’ operating costs. The countries that offer high-quality office space at relatively low rent are seen as favorable business destinations. Exhibit 16 depicts the comparison between countries on the basis of average annual rentals of Grade A office space in terms of US$ per sq. m. per annum. The rentals are for office space in central business districts (CBD) and suburban business districts (SBD) in important cities in each country. The average has been computed by providing 80% weight to rentals at low-cost locations and 20% weight to rentals at high-cost locations within a country. Key observations • ► Israel ranks the highest on this parameter, with average annual rentals of US$224 per sq. m. per annum. • ► With US$587 per sq. m. per annum, Sweden is home to the costliest office spaces. • ► Other developed countries such as the US and the UK also rank low on this parameter. • ► India, with US$278 average annual rentals for Grade A office space, has one of the lowest rentals among the sample set of countries. It ranks third on this parameter, closely following Taiwan, where rentals are US$271 per sq. m. per annum. Takeaways for India • ► India performs well on this parameter, and with nearly 21 million sq. ft. of Grade A office space expected to be developed in the next one year in major cities and a high current vacancy rate, average annual rentals in India are expected to remain low vis-à-vis other countries in the sample set. Chapter 5.a. details the benchmarking of countries on the availability of office space.

Average cost of electricity Electricity costs constitute an important constituent of operational cost, but assume less significance, since semiconductor design is not power intensive. Exhibit 17 represents average cost of electricity per unit (1 unit = 1 Kilowatt hour) in US cents for commercial consumers in a country. Key observations • ► With the lowest per unit cost of electricity among the sample set of countries, Taiwan ranks first on this parameter. • ► Germany, where commercial customers pay approximately US$0.20 per unit for electricity ranks last. • ► India ranks seventh on this parameter ahead of Germany. Commercial customers in India pay around US$0.17 per unit of electricity. Takeaways for India • ► Apart from being a power-deficit nation, India has one of the highest per unit costs among the sample set of countries. • ► Although the semiconductor design sector is not power-intensive, low electricity costs help reduce overall operating costs for companies, therefore enhancing a country’s cost- competitive edge.Exhibit 17: Average cost of electricity 0510152025 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaElectricity cost (US cents per KWh) Source: Multiple; refer references on page 127 101 Section 2: Benchmarking 4.c. Average annual salaries of semiconductor design personnel The semiconductor design sector requires a highly skilled and trained workforce. Human resource costs, thus, constitute a major expense for semiconductor design companies, as skilled personnel come at relatively low salaries. Exhibit 18 compares the countries on the basis of average salaries of semiconductor design professionals in terms of US$ per annum. Key observations • ► With annual compensation of around US$16,900, semiconductor design professionals employed in China draw the lowest salaries among the sample set of countries. • ► Average annual salaries of semiconductor design professionals working in the US are the highest. The estimated figure is around US$93,669. • ► Other developed countries also have much higher levels of salary as compared to developing countries. • ► The average salary cost in India is US$29,246, which places the country second among the sample set of countries. Takeaways for India • ► India performs very well in terms of salaries of semiconductor design professionals. Average salaries in India are higher than in China but significantly lower than all the developed countries in the sample set. • ► With a large number of skilled graduates being produced in India every year, the country is expected to maintain this talent cost advantage in future. Benchmarking on the number of relevant engineers produced in a country has been discussed in Chapter 2.b.Exhibit 18: Average annual salary of semiconductor design personnel 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00090,000100,000 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaAverage annual salary (in US$) Source: Multiple; refer references on page 127 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry102 4.d. Cost of raising debt New businesses require adequate funding from different sources to establish their operations. The cost of raising debt from banks affects the profitability of businesses, as interest costs may constitute one of the major cost components for startups. The higher the interest cost in a country, the lower is the incentive to set up a new business. Exhibit 19 compares the sample set of countries on the basis of the prime lending rates offered by commercial banks in the country. Prime lending rate is the underlying index that banks use to determine the interest rate they offer to their customers on the basis of their credit rating. Key observations • ► The UK ranks first on this parameter, with the lowest interest cost in the sample set. • ► Banks in India offer a base interest rate of around 8%, which is highest among the sample set of countries. Therefore, the country ranks last on this parameter. Takeaways for India • ► High interest cost is a deterrent for new businesses seeking to initiate operations. Commercial banks in India should encourage start-ups by reducing the thrust on collateral security and offering loan on more liberal terms. • ► Banks in India also need to streamline their credit-appraisal process to reduce the time to sanction loans and, thus, enhance the ease of obtaining loans.

Travel cost Travel cost is an important parameter under consideration, because employees of multinational companies are required to travel to different countries across the world for business-related activities. Travel cost has been estimated by taking the average of per diem rates in major cities of a country. This rate covers lodging, meals and incidental expenses. Exhibit 20 compares per diem rates across sample set countries. Key observations • The US ranks first on this parameter, with the lowest per diem rate of US$159 in the sample set of countries. • Sweden, with the highest per diem rate of US$404, ranks last among the sample set of countries. • India ranks fourth on this parameter, closely behind Germany, with an average per diem rate of US$349. Takeaways for India • India is an expensive business destination in terms of travel charges as compared to other developing countries such as China and Taiwan. • The high charges of business hotels and costly local travel are major components leading to India’s high value of per diem charges. Exhibit 20: Per diem rate 050100150200250300350400450 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaPer diem cost (in US$) Source: Multiple; refer references on page 128 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry104 Operating costs: summary India is highly competitive in terms of two major components of operating costs for businesses. Salary cost forms the major component of operating costs for design companies. Grade A office space rentals in India are among the lowest in the sample set of countries. A high ranking on these parameters makes India an attractive destination for the establishment of captive design units by companies in the US and Europe. The cost of raising debt in India is the highest among the sample set of countries. Interest cost is not an important parameter from the perspective of captives, since these are generally cost centers; however, it is very important for new business start-ups. Travel costs in India are high as compared to developing nations such as China and Taiwan. The cost of electricity is also high in India but it is not a major cause for concern, since the semiconductor design sector is not power-intensive. 105 Section 2: Benchmarking 5. Infrastructure This chapter focuses on the fifth benchmarking parameter – infrastructure. The availability of quality physical infrastructure is important for the efficient working of any business in a country. It includes quality office space, adequate international internet bandwidth, reliable supply of electricity and sound connectivity with developed markets. The benchmarking parameters in this category are: • Future availability of Grade A-quality office space • Demand-supply gap in power • Availability of communications infrastructure Data on office space has been collected using research reports published by global real estate consulting majors. The majority of electricity statistics has been collected from the websites of government energy departments and statistical databases of countries in the sample set. The quality of overall infrastructure rating has been obtained from the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report 2010–2011 .Exhibit 21 Benchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1. Talent pool2.

Future availability of Grade A office space Companies looking to establish business in a country require quality office space with adequate facilities to conduct their operations. Grade A office space consists of buildings that are newly constructed or recently redeveloped at prime locations in major cities. These offices boast of high-quality furnishings, the latest facilities, and excellent accessibility. Thus, these are the most sought-after locations for multinational companies looking to establish offices. Exhibit 22 compares the future availability of Grade A-quality office space in each country across key cities. Expected supply takes into account new construction that is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in the next one year in major cities across the country. Key observations • In terms of future availability of office space, China and the US are the leading countries with a significant pipeline of upcoming office infrastructure. • Taiwan, followed by Sweden, has the smallest pipeline of new office space. • There is a major pipeline of Grade A office space planned for India, with around 21 million sq. ft. to be added in the next one year. The country ranks third after China and the US in terms of future availability of high-quality office space. Takeaways for India • The fast pace of economic development, leading to the establishment of new businesses and rapid expansion by existing companies, is a prime factor for such rapid development of office space infrastructure. • Mumbai and Bengaluru are the leading cities in India in terms of current and future availability of Grade A office space.Exhibit 22: Future availability of Grade A office space 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaExpected supply (in '000 square feet) Source: Multiple; refer references on page 128 107 Section 2: Benchmarking 5.b. Power demand-supply gap Power is an important infrastructure parameter, as companies do not consider countries with power deficit as attractive investment locations to set up operations. Businesses operating in such countries have to invest in power backup infrastructure, which increases set-up and operating costs. Exhibit 23 compares the power demand and supply situation between countries in the sample set. Key observations • Germany leads the sample set of countries in terms of the demand-supply scenario, with approximately 10% excess power generation as compared to demand. • China ranks last on this parameter, with around 7% deficiency in supply. • Among developed countries, the UK is the only country that is power deficient, and meets its demand through import of electricity. • India faces a power deficit of 6.85% and features among the lowest ranks on this parameter. However, India performs slightly better than China, which faces a similar demand- supply gap. Takeaways for India • The electricity supply situation has improved in India over the years due to enhanced power-generation capacity and the entry of several private players in the power generation sector. • Power-generation capacity in India is currently around 162,367 MW. • The power demand-supply gap is expected to reduce further in future on account of several power projects in the pipeline. • Although the semiconductor design sector is not power-intensive, India still needs to tackle outages from time to time in major cities by improving power-distribution infrastructure. • Assured and uninterrupted power supply is likely to reduce the cost of investing in back-up sources.Exhibit 23: Power demand-supply gap -10%-8%-6%-4%-2%0%2%4%6%8%10% US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaSupply exceeds demand Demand exceeds supply Source: Multiple; refer references on page 128 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry108 5.c. Availability of communications infrastructure Communications infrastructure in a country is an indicator of the country’s international connectivity. Developing nations are home to several captive design centers of US- and Europe-based companies. As a result, they require high-quality international connectivity. Further, developed nations possess quality infrastructure with sufficiently high bandwidth. Therefore, this parameter is more important from the perspective of developing nations as compared to developed nations. Exhibit 24 compares developing nations on the basis of availability of communications infrastructure. This parameter has been measured using international internet bandwidth availability in each country. International internet bandwidth is the contracted capacity of international connections between countries for transmitting internet traffic. Key observations • ► China leads among the developing countries in the sample set with a bandwidth of 846 Gbps. • ► Israel has the lowest bandwidth among the developing nations. • ► India ranks second among the developing nations. Its bandwidth capacity of 368 Gbps is similar to that of Taiwan (363 Gbps). Takeaways for India • ► India has made rapid progress on this parameter over the years, and bandwidth is no longer a constraint. • ► India now has ample bandwidth to provide companies with high-quality international connectivity.Exhibit 24: Availability of communications infrastructure 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900IndiaIsraelTaiwanChina Bandwidth (in Gbps) Source: Multiple; refer references on page 129 109 Section 2: Benchmarking Infrastructure: summary Over the years, India has advanced rapidly in terms of quality infrastructure. The country’s growing economy has led to the rapid expansion of businesses. This has resulted in the construction of new, high-quality office buildings and the development of special economic zones (SEZs) across the country. With a high vacancy rate, currently and a large number of constructions in the pipeline, India is well-poised to provide high-quality office space to companies that want to set up operations in India. The power demand-supply gap in India has also improved over the years, although the country remains a power-deficient economy. With a number of private players entering the power-generation business, India’s power-supply scenario is set to improve in future. India has overcome its bandwidth constraints of the past and now has ample capacity to provide high-speed international connectivity to companies.

Quality of business environment determines the ease of doing business in a country. Business environment includes factors such as the complexity involved in starting a new business and taxation rates in the country. IP rights protection is important to safeguard the rights and interests of businesses engaged in R&D. Since the semiconductor design industry involves substantial IP creation, it is very important that a country’s legal framework is efficient enough to prevent IP-related thefts by implementing strict laws. The benchmarking parameters used in this category are: • ► Number of procedures required to start a business • ► Corporate taxation rate • ► Efficiency of the legal framework in challenging regulations Information on these parameters has been collected from WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report 2010–2011 and the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s Doing Business 2011 report by the World Bank. Information on the parameters and their comparison reflects the business environment in the countries as a whole, and is not specific to the semiconductor design sector.Exhibit 25 Benchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Number of procedures to start a business Legal regulations of a country require certain procedures to be completed to incorporate and register the new firm before it can start operations. Countries with efficient processes have a higher entry rate as they encourage entrepreneurs to set up businesses. Exhibit 26 compares the countries in the sample set on the basis of number of procedures to start a business. Key observations • ► Sweden ranks the highest among the sample set of countries in terms of number of procedures to start a new business. Companies need to complete only three procedures to start a new business in Sweden. • ► China requires 14 procedures to be completed before a new business can become operational. It ranks last on this parameter. • ► India requires 12 procedures to be completed and, therefore, features among the lowest ranked on this parameter. It lags behind all countries in the sample set except China. • ► According to Doing Business 2011, it takes 8 procedures on an average to start a business around the world. India lags behind the world average. Takeaways for India • ► Typical procedures in India include registering the company name with the Registrar of Companies (ROC), getting the company incorporated, making a seal, obtaining a permanent account number (PAN) and tax account number, and registering for Value Added Tax (VAT), professional tax, and employees provident fund organization (EPFO). • ► India could improve on this parameter by implementing simpler and faster procedures. It can also work on transitioning some procedures online to decrease the time and complexities involved.Exhibit 26: Number of procedures to start a business 0246810121416 USWorld average = 8 UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaNumber of procedures Source: Doing Business 2011, World Bank, IFC and Palgrave MacMillan, October 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry112 6.b. Corporate taxation rate The competitiveness, investment and growth of businesses can be restricted by governments by imposing heavy taxes. High tax rates lower the profits of companies and are thus discouraging for businesses. Exhibit 27 compares the statutory corporate taxation rate in each country. Key observations • Germany ranks the highest on this parameter, with a corporate taxation rate of 15%. • ► The US, with a corporate taxation rate of 34%, ranks last on this parameter. • ► With a 30% corporate tax rate, India has the highest rate among the developing countries in the sample set.Exhibit 27: Statutory corporate taxation rate 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35% US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaCorporate tax rate Source: Doing Business 2011, World Bank, IFC and Palgrave MacMillan, October 2010 113 Section 2: Benchmarking Takeaways for India • Apart from corporate tax, companies are required to pay other taxes in all countries. These include turnover tax, labor taxes, personal income tax withheld by the company, VAT or sales tax, property tax, property transfer tax, dividend tax, capital gains tax, financial transactions tax, waste collection tax, vehicle and road taxes and other small taxes (such as stamp duty and local taxes). • ► In India, the composition of other taxes is as follows (as % of gross profits): • Central Sales Tax (17.1%) • Social security contributions (13.5%) • Employee state insurance contribution (4.6%) • Property tax (3.3%) • Dividend tax (3.8%) • Fuel tax (0.4%) • Fringe benefit tax (0.1%) • Tax on insurance contracts (0.2%) • ► In 2009—10, Israel and China reduced corporate income tax rates, thereby increasing their competitiveness by helping businesses to grow. • ► Although corporate taxation in India is higher than that in other countries within the sample set, the GoI provides a number of tax incentives to companies setting up operations in SEZs and STPIs. As an example, companies engaged in the export of goods and services are eligible for 100% income tax exemption for the first five years of operations and 50% exemption for the next five years of operations. • ► As discussed in Chapter 1 on industry dynamics, a stable tax structure needs to be in place in order to encourage companies to make long-term investments in the semiconductor design and electronics production sector. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry114 6.c. Legal framework efficiency in challenging regulations The legal framework of a country is important for the development of the country’s innovation capabilities. Companies that possess IP are not likely to be willing to invest in innovation and R&D if their rights as IP owners are insecure. This requires a business environment that supports innovation. An efficient legal framework helps protect the companies’ IP and settles disputes quickly and effectively. Therefore, it encourages companies to undertake more R&D activities. Exhibit 28 depicts the rankings of the countries on the efficiency of the legal framework in challenging regulations. The more efficient is the country’s legal framework for private businesses in challenging the legality of government actions and regulations, the higher is the country’s ranking on this parameter. Key observations • ► Sweden ranks best among the sample set of countries, as well as globally indicating a highly efficient framework in challenging regulations. • ► China has a global rank of 51, and ranks last among the sample set of countries. • ► With a global rank of 37, India ranks fifth in the sample set, ahead of China, Taiwan and Israel.Exhibit 28: Global rankings on efficiency of the legal framework in challenging regulations 0510152025303540455055 US UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaGlobal rankings Source: Global competitiveness report 2010–2011, The World Economic Forum 115 Section 2: Benchmarking Takeaways for India • India ranks higher than other developing countries in terms of its legal framework’s efficiency in challenging government regulations. • In terms of the IP protection scenario in India with respect to the semiconductor design sector, a discussion with semiconductor industry professionals in India indicates that companies largely consider the country to be ahead of China. IP protection laws for the semiconductor design sector are more stringent in India than in China. • To be able to further drive innovation, India’s IP protection regime needs improvement through the implementation of strict laws. The Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design (SICLD) Act, 2000 governs integrated circuit (IC) layout designs in India. • The act is aimed to protect IP rights for semiconductor IC design layouts. • Layout design shall be registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing the application or from the date of first commercial use anywhere in India or in any country, whichever is earlier. • Layout design that is not commercially exploited for more than two years from its date of registration shall be treated as commercially exploited for the purpose of this act. • Reproducing, distributing, selling or importing the IC layout design for commercial purposes will lead to infringement of law. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry116 Quality of business environment: summary India lags behind developed nations in terms of overall quality of business environment. The number of procedures required to start a new business in India are on the higher side. It could improve on this aspect by simplifying the steps involved to set up a new business and enabling the online completion of some procedures. Further, in terms of taxation, the GoI imposes several taxes, apart from corporate tax, which reduce profitability. To improve India’s attractiveness as a business destination, the GoI should reduce the burden of taxes on startups. The efficiency of the legal framework in India will play a major role in the development of the country’s innovation capabilities in the near future. India already has a Semiconductor IC Design Layout Act in place to protect the interests of IP owners of semiconductor design. While India performs better than other developing countries in terms of efficiency of its legal framework in challenging government regulations, GoI needs to make the legal framework more efficient by resolving disputes more efficiently and timely. 117 Section 2: Benchmarking Government policies and support The semiconductor design sector involves a lot of expenditure on R&D. Government support in the form of R&D incentives, tax holidays and loan grants can help companies sustain research initiatives and remain profitable. Government support in developing fabrication, assembly testing and packaging units, and for other sectors related to semiconductors, such as electronics, help create an overall ecosystem in the country. These initiatives help a country become a favorable investment destination. The countries in the sample set provide businesses engaged in the semiconductor and related sectors with different kinds of incentives. Prominent among these are: Taiwan The Government of Taiwan has taken several initiatives to reduce risks and enhance the competitiveness and innovation capability of businesses engaged in research activities. The Government of Taiwan has developed the Hsin-chu Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) following the model of Silicon Valley in the US to create an environment conducive to the development of a high-technology industry (including semiconductors). The park’s proximity to two of Taiwan’s oldest universities gives it the advantages of a skilled labor supply and low employee training costs, apart from the advantages an industrial cluster enjoys. The Government of Taiwan also provides for zero tax, exemption from import duties and certain other taxes on products manufactured for export in more such designated science parks. In order to provide companies with technological and R&D support, the Government of Taiwan has established research institutions such as the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), which has several laboratories that collaborate with private-sector companies to build their research competitiveness. The National Science and Technology Projects (NSTP) provide financial stability to ITRI. Some of ITRI researchers join private sector companies, which increase R&D capabilities of the private sector. The Government of Taiwan enacted the Statute for Upgrading Industries in 1990 and amended it in 2003. The statute encourages the hi-technology industry by providing a five-year holiday on corporate income tax, applicable to the entire income for the newly incorporated company, and on incremental income from new construction or expansion for pre-existing and qualifying companies.III. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry118 A company in Taiwan is eligible for a 30% credit for R&D expenses against income tax payable for five years, starting from the year the company begins R&D activity. If this expenditure exceeds the average of the preceding two years, 50% of the excess amount may be offset against income tax payable that year. Equipment and machinery used for R&D can be depreciated completely over a two-year period. The Government of Taiwan also offered a major incentive to the semiconductor design industry in 2002 through the launch of a Si-Soft project. The project aimed at developing resources to create a skilled workforce for the semiconductor design sector and the establishment of an IC design park. Under this project, the Nankang IC design science-park was initiated in July 2003. This collaborative effort with Hsinchu and Tainan science-based industrial parks and Nankang Software Park, aimed to increase the faculty count specializing in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design at universities and introduce several new courses in semiconductor design as a part of the curriculum to produce more design engineers annually. The overall objective was to promote IP creation by IC design units in Taiwan. China Since 2000, the Government of China has been actively involved in implementing favorable tax policies and providing incentives to companies to develop a competitive semiconductor industry. After 2000, government policies saw major changes. Before 2000, semiconductor firms were mostly government-owned or joint ventures involving a government entity as the Chinese partner. FDI in the sector was highly restricted. After 2000, the Government of China started encouraging foreign investment in the sector while holding only a passive minority stake in enterprises. Tariffs on semiconductors, which were in the range of 6%–30% before 2000, were completely removed. Steps were also taken to promote the IC design industry. Earlier, the emphasis was on state-owned research institutes, while after 2000, the Government of China privatized these institutes and also provided financial assistance to private companies to conduct R&D activities. Under the Tenth Five Year Plan, the semiconductor industry has been designated as an encouraged industry, and the Government of China laid down a number of policies to promote industry growth. Since 2008, China’s taxation laws for the semiconductor manufacturing sector, , have allowed for a five-year tax holiday involving full exemption from corporate income tax for the first five years, starting in the year in which the business becomes profitable. For the next five years, these businesses are required to pay half the applicable tax rate. Another incentive is the R&D tax deduction. Companies engaged in R&D activity for the production of new technologies, products, or techniques can enjoy a 50% “super deduction” above the actual expense deduction. IC manufacturers are exempt from paying import duties and 17% VAT on IC production equipment and machinery. They are also granted easy customs clearance. 119 Section 2: Benchmarking Some local incentives are also available to the semiconductor industry. For example, under a “virtual fab” strategy adopted by some local governments, the construction of a fabrication plant is either completely or largely government-funded, but contracted private firms manage the process under a profit-sharing agreement. As another example, for pre-approved R&D centers, The Pudong New Area in Shanghai refunds land-use fees and subsidizes property taxes under the Pudong Technology Development Fund. India The GoI provides several incentives and tax benefits to the semiconductor industry and related sectors for the overall development of the semiconductor ecosystem in India. The GoI offers a weighted deduction of 150% on any expenditure on in-house scientific research by companies engaged in electronic equipment manufacturing. Further, a 10-year tax deduction is offered for 100% of profits derived from the export of certain products by companies located in SEZs, an electronic hardware technology park, and free trade zones, among others. The GoI introduced the National Semiconductor Policy in 2007 to encourage investments in the establishment of fabrication units. It covers production, assembly and testing of semiconductors, photovoltaics, LCDs, plasmas, storage devices, solar cells and nanotechnology products. For the implementation of the policy, the GoI launched the Special Incentives Package Scheme (SIPS). According to this scheme, businesses setting up qualifying wafer-fabrication facilities with a minimum investment of US$581 million will be eligible for government grants. For units located inside SEZs, the GoI will provide 20% of the capital expenditure for the first 10 years of operations. For units outside SEZs, countervailing duty (CVD) on capital goods will be exempt, and the GoI will be responsible for 25% of the capital expenditure for the stated duration. The scheme limits the equity participation of the GoI in the project to a maximum of 26%, assuming a 1:1 debt equity ratio for the project. The rest will be in the form of interest-free loans, tax subsidies and concessions. The policy also provides state governments with the option to offer semiconductor companies additional benefits. Some state governments also provide incentives for the development of the semiconductor industry. For example, the Government of Karnataka introduced a semiconductor policy in February 2010. The policy is aimed at providing financial assistance to start-up design units through Karnataka Information Technology Venture Capital (KITVEN) Fund. It will also provide financial assistance to firms for filing IP. The GoI plans to set up industrial parks and SEZs following the model of Hsinchu Park in Taiwan and Suzhou Park in China. These SEZs are expected to offer benefits such as low rentals on land, tax benefits, exemptions from certain tariffs and low-interest government loans. Some of the fiscal incentives listed in the Karnataka Industrial Policy 2009–14 include exemption from stamp duty to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), large and mega projects, an investment promotion subsidy, interest free loan on VAT to large and mega projects, and interest subsidy to micro manufacturing enterprises. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry120 Israel The Government of Israel has entitled foreign investors to a 10% corporate income tax rate. If the business is set up in central Israel, investors are also eligible for a two-year exemption from that tax. A 10-year full tax exemption can be provided in case the company is located outside of central Israel. Taxation laws allow for a full deduction of R&D expenses, including capital expenditures in the year in which the expenditures are made. Further, a qualified R&D plan makes the company eligible for grants ranging between 20%¬ and 50% of R&D expenses. Grants depend upon the amount of local production and the contribution of R&D to Israeli research. Non- Israeli residents are eligible for full capital gain tax exemption for the sale of shares in an “intensive R&D company.” US The US Government provides the semiconductor industry with several tax incentives through the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Since 2008, the Government of the US has been offering a 14% alternative credit for qualifying R&D expenditures above 50% of the average qualified research expenditures over the three years before the credit year. A major drawback is that this R&D incentive is on a temporary basis and lasts for one or two years. It is required to be renewed after the stated period. Companies enjoy certain state-level tax incentives, but there is no provision of tax holidays from the US federal corporate income tax. The US also offers 3.15% tax deduction for manufacturing activities in the domestic semiconductor sector. UK The Government of the UK offers incentives to companies involved in R&D. Such companies are entitled to claim a deduction on their taxable profits if they spend at least £10,000 in their accounting year on qualifying R&D activities. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can claim 175% of qualifying expenditure (incurred after 1 August 2008). Large companies can claim 130% of expenditure (incurred after 1 April 2008). SMEs making losses are eligible to claim credit of 24% of qualifying expenditure. Further, SMEs are not required to own any IP attributable to their R&D expenditure as a condition of being able to claim. Companies are allowed to claim R&D tax credits to incur costs on employing staff engaged in conducting R&D activities, material used, as well as power, water and computer software used directly in conducting R&D activities. 121 Section 2: Benchmarking Germany The Government of Germany provides a number of incentives for domestic and foreign investors in the electronics and micro-technology industry. The Government of Germany’s investment incentives package provides cash incentives, loans at low interest rates and public guarantees to secure loan from private banks for companies looking to establish businesses in the country. Depending upon the size of the company, investment location and project scope, these incentives can amount to as much as 30% of expenditures for large enterprises and 50% for small enterprises. The Government of Germany’s operational incentives package is aimed at providing support to companies engaged in R&D. All R&D incentive programs are part of the Government of Germany’s four-year high-technology strategy, under which an annual reserve of €3 billion has been provided for non-repayable project grants. Sweden The Government of Sweden does not provide any specific incentives for the semiconductor industry in particular, but supports R&D activities across industrial sectors in the country. Primary government support is in the form of grants for R&D projects. The Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) is one of the major agencies to which companies can apply for R&D grants. The agency’s aim is to enhance the competitiveness of research activities in the country. The agency’s annual budget to finance R&D activities is approximately SEK2 billion. Other agencies in Sweden such as the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, Knowledge Foundation and Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth also fund R&D projects in the country.

Sweden Sweden embassy Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry130 Recommendations Section 3 131 Section 3: Recommendations Recommendations Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry132 This study on the Indian semiconductor and embedded design services industry has been commissioned by the Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, India, with the intention of providing a thorough and systematic analysis of the Industry. It highlights India’s growth and positioning in the global semiconductor design industry to identify areas of improvement and frame recommendations for the Indian semiconductor design industry. This report is jointly prepared by the India Semiconductor Association and Ernst & Young Pvt. Ltd. The output of the study is presented in three sections: Section 1: Industry analysis This section throws light on the global semiconductor design and embedded software industry with a focus on the Indian industry. It discusses the ecosystem for semiconductor design development, the status of intellectual property in the industry and the talent landscape. It also provides estimates of industry revenues, workforce demand and supply, demographics, trends in terms of technology nodes and business models, and highlights the key drivers of and the challenges faced across the following three segments of domestic industry: • Very large scale integration (VLSI) design segment • Embedded software design segment • Board/hardware design segment This section also discusses the nuances of the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) market in terms of global and Indian markets, their drivers, the challenges faced by them and their license models. Section 2: Benchmarking The objective of the benchmarking exercise is to provide a competitive assessment of India against seven countries considered pioneers of semiconductor design. Quantitative benchmarking compares various parameters such as industry dynamics, talent pool, infrastructure, operating costs, quality of the business environment, and innovation and IP, which are all pivotal to the development of a country’s semiconductor design sector. This analysis aims to highlight the challenges India faces vis-à-vis its competitors and the model to develop based on best practices adopted worldwide. Section 3: Recommendations Key issues relating to the growth of the semiconductor design industry are summarized, based on the findings of the Industry report. In the Benchmarking exercise, elaborate recommendations have been made to tackle the issues mentioned above. This will be a valuable source of data for the Government of India, the industry and academia, and can be used to plan and influence government policies for the domestic semiconductor design industry, building a strong ecosystem for the industry and bridging the gap in the talent scenario.About this study 133 Section 3: Recommendations Contents Section 3: Recommendations Recommendations 134 Synopsis of challenges 134 Details of issues and actionable recommendations 136 Roadmap for recommendations implementation 162 Addressal of challenges with stakeholder responsibility 164 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry134 Recommendations The Indian semiconductor design industry is estimated to have contributed US$6.6 billion as revenues in 2009 and employs close to 135,000 people in semiconductor design besides providing employment to numerous people by means of indirect labor. The central and state governments in India recognize the strategic value of the semiconductor industry and have proactively made attempts to support the industry by unveiling policies aimed at growing the semiconductor footprint in the country. In spite of the efforts made by the government, the Indian semiconductor industry faces challenges on numerous fronts in terms of competition from other countries, fast changing technology and increasing cost pressures. To help the Indian semiconductor industry reach its potential, government, academia, industry players and industry associations need to work together to improve India’s business environment. In the absence of such a concentrated effort, the industry will fall significantly short of capturing its potential. This section attempts to provide actionable recommendations to the challenges identified in the industry study and benchmarking exercise, which involved detailed discussions with industry experts coupled with intensive secondary research. This will be a valuable source of data for the Government of India, industry and academia to be used for planning and influencing government policies toward the semiconductor design industry, bridging the gap in the talent scenario and building a strong ecosystem for the semiconductor design industry. The section is studied under the following sub-sections: • Synopsis of challenges • Details of issues and actionable recommendations • Roadmap for recommendations • Addressing of challenges and stakeholder responsibility Synopsis of challenges Based on the findings observed during the industry report and the benchmarking exercise, we have identified a set of 20 challenges faced by the Indian semiconductor industry today. These challenges are presented in Exhibit 1 below. 135 Section 3: Recommendations Exhibit 1: Complete set of challenges faced Section Sub-section Challenges Section 1: Industry analysis India industry overview • People-related challenges • Quality of talent • Lack of technical career path • Attrition • Eroding cost advantage • Lack of semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem • Competition from China, Taiwan and other South-East Asian Countries • Protectionist policies adopted by other nations VLSI design industry • Lack of R&D funding in universities • Lack of scale at the leading node Embedded software industry • Cost pressures due to constantly evolving hardware • Integration and testing of software and hardware • Skill-set availability for high-end programmers • Preference of ADM services as a career option Board/hardware design industry• ►Compliance related challenges • Lack of component ecosystem development • Adoption of de-risking business models by customers • Official policies Section 2: Benchmarking Infrastructure • ►Deficient power supply • Inadequate logistics infrastructure Cost • ►High electricity cost Business environment • ►High and unstable corporate tax structure • Low efficiency of legal framework Government support • ►Expiry of the national level semiconductor policy Industry dynamics • ►Inadequate electronics production Source: ISA—EY research 2010 This entire set of challenges can be summarized under four main issues: • ► Issue 1 – Quality, availability and maturity of talent • ► Issue 2 – Building a startup and SME ecosystem • ► Issue 3 - Absence of a semiconductor ecosystem • ► Issue 4 - Lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and implementable incentives • ► Issue 5 – External issues affecting the Indian semiconductor industry Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry136 Goals envisaged for the Indian semiconductor design industry While the issues need to be addressed by actionable recommendations, specific goals are envisaged for the Indian semiconductor industry to provide a general direction to the recommendations. The four specific goals envisaged are: Details of issues and actionable recommendations This section takes up each one of four issues identified above and discusses them in detail. Elaborate potential recommendations to tackle these issues are articulated to enable the Indian semiconductor industry reach its complete potential. Issue 1: Quality, availability and maturity of talent Results from the industry analysis and benchmarking study shows that India scores well on current and future availability of talent with 61% of engineers graduating every year belonging to disciplines relevant for semiconductor design. However, this available talent is not readily deployable. As the semiconductor design sector is highly knowledge intensive, quality of talent produced is a very big challenge. The launch of the Special Manpower Development Programme (SMDP) by the Indian government is a welcome step in this direction. Maintain leadership in semiconductor design by incubating 50 fabless semiconductor companies, each with the potential to grow to US$ 200 million in annual revenues by 2020Goal 1 Build on India's favorable intellectual property protection image and make it among the top 5 destinations for intellectual property creation in the semiconductor design industry Goal 2 Capitalize on indigenous demand in strategic sectors to provide impetus to the Indian fabless semiconductor industry Goal 3 Sustain and nurture high-class semiconductor design manpower at a growth rate of 20% year-on- year to double its current output levels to reach a workforce size of 400,000 in the next five yearsGoal 4Exhibit 2 Source: ISA—EY research 2010 137 Section 3: Recommendations Recommendations: The detailed recommendations toward facilitating better quality of talent can be summarized as under: Each of these recommendations is discussed below in detail: Recommendation 1A: Feedback on the SMDP II After discussions with SMDP coordinators, faculty members and Head of Departments at Resource Centers (RCs) and Participating Institutes (PIs), the following observations were made: Objective: Involvement of more PIs in SMDP III SMDP III needs enlargement in its scope to reach out and include more institutions as PIs in line with its vision. While SMDP II was a step in this direction with the number of PIs increasing from 12 to 25 from SMDP I, this trend needs to continue with SMDP III. • ► SMDP III, if initiated, should focus largely on targeted system deliverables, such as SoCs • ► These system deliverables should be designed by multiple institutions • ► For the implementation of this program, it should be a collaborative program run on a public-private mode • ► To achieve this program, SMDP III needs enlargement in scope to reach out and include more institutions as PIs • According to our estimates provided below, 11–14 more colleges must be introduced as PIs to bridge the demand supply gap by 2012. • The existing PIs can be evaluated and those which have become self-sufficient and graduated to the level of RCs can be promoted, which will ultimately help to expand to include the 11–14 additional PIs.Goal No. AddressedImprovement areaIn-depth recommendations elaborated 4 Talent 1A) Feedback on the Special Manpower Development Programme II (SMDP II) 1B) Set up specialized institutes for semiconductor design Type I Manpower 58 Type II Manpower 672 Type III Manpower 892 Type IV Manpower 3849 Total 5471 Source: ISA—EY research 20107,700 Hence, to bridge the demand- supply gap (7700 - 5471), about 11 – 14 more colleges need to be introduced as PIsManpower demand required by 2012 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry138 Leverage National Knowledge Network (NKN) for SMDP III: NKN aims to connect more than 1,500 knowledge and research institutes in the country using a high-bandwidth network. As R&D activities and innovation in semiconductor design industry require multidisciplinary knowledge, NKN can be leveraged to connect geographically separated high-quality semiconductor design research centers and engineering colleges providing education in fields related to semiconductor design. The SMDP module can gain significantly from NKN if all RCs and PIs under it gets connected. The network will facilitate data and resource sharing among all colleges. The workshops conducted under instruction enhancement programme (IEP) can take place online, which will increase faculty participation as they are not likely to require leaves to travel to other engineering colleges. A lot of learning material can be provided online to students, which can be updated by institutes regularly to include latest technology. The students can leverage the expertise of faculties across engineering colleges and can take up projects under professors in their area of interest. The infrastructure provided by NKN can also lead to inclusion of more institutes under the umbrella of the SMDP program. This can prove to be very useful in creating world class semiconductor research institutions producing a pool of high quality design professionals. Recommendation 1B: Setup specialized institutes for semiconductor design India does not have specialized semiconductor design institutes, which focus on training students and carrying out research activities. Recommendation: Set up four technology institutes specific to semiconductor design with government and industry players as key stakeholders. To begin with, one institute can be setup and based on its success, the other three can be initiated. While providing this recommendation, best practices have been taken from specialized institutes such as Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC) in Belgium, VLSI Design and Education Center (VDEC) in Japan and the nano-centers setup in IIT Bombay and IISc. Objective: The proposed institutes should be set up with an aim to bridge the gap between fundamental research taking place in universities and colleges and technology development happening in industry. IMEC Belgium IMEC is an independent research center carrying out high-level innovative research in the field of microelectronics and nanotechnology in Leuven, Belgium. This was set up as a non-profit organization in 1984. The center has state of art fabrication tools with 200 mm processing facility, advanced laboratories for microelectronics research and a training program for VLSI design engineers. The current development at the center is toward 32 nm technology node. The organization has approximately 1,750 employees including 550 guest researchers and industrial residents. Revenues for 2009 were €275 million. 139 Section 3: Recommendations VDEC Japan VDEC has been set up in the University of Tokyo and is shared by researchers all over Japan. The institute works for the improvement of instruction methods for VLSI design, distributes updated VLSI design-related information, provides CAD software and licenses and supports chip fabrications for universities and colleges in Japan. More than 600 research groups and 150 universities in Japan are using services of VDEC. Model: Following is the model based on which the proposed institutes should be set up: Working model • Institutes as education centers The institutes will act as education centers and will: • Invite graduate engineers to pursue their M.Tech in areas specific to semiconductor design • Offer post graduates in semiconductor design to carry out their doctorate thesis. • Offer one-year Executive MBA program for development of project management skills • Institutes as independent research hubs • Will double up as independent research hubs and will aim to become nodal points for the majority of semiconductor research taking place in the country. • Will employ design professionals to carry out high level research that will run three to five years ahead of industrial needs. • Will invite guest researchers from academia as well as industry experts to carry out design research as industrial residents in the campus. • Will also aim to attract foreign nationals to carry out research at the campus. • State of art infrastructure The institutes should have highly experienced and well qualified faculty and should be well equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and latest public domain and propriety design tools. Funding and revenues • Initial funding • Initially, the government should fund 50% of the set-up cost, of these institutes; the rest can be raised from the industry and other investors. • EDA tool companies should be invited to contribute in laboratory infrastructure development by providing design tools at a highly subsidized cost • Ongoing funding • These will be set up as non-profit organizations and will earn revenues by providing industry-relevant technology solutions to companies and academia. • The revenues will be utilized for paying salaries to employees and faculty, stipend to researchers and development of state-of-art infrastructure. Sector and technology focus• Sector focus • In the first phase, these institutes should focus on research activities specific to sectors of national importance such as defense, healthcare and infrastructure for developing high-level design methodologies and new process technologies for next generation of chips. • In the second phase, they can extend their research to sectors such as multimedia, telecommunications, energy and transport. • Technology focus The process development at the research level should be aimed at 45 nm and below devices. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry140 Location • Locations The institutes should be set-up near the four major clusters of semiconductor design — Bengaluru, NCR, Pune and Hyderabad. • Location advantages • These locations will help students obtain live projects and take up internships in nearby design units from semiconductor design companies to gain hands-on experience. • The institutes can also invite experienced design professionals from industry for guest lectures as it will be easier for them to travel to nearby places. Board of Directors • ► Board of Directors should consist of delegates from industry, IITs, IISc, government and distinguished faculty from well established foreign institutes. Courses offered • ► M.Tech • ► Ph.D. • ► Executive MBA • ► Short-term industry relevant courses Faculty • ► Collaboration with IITs/IISc for faculty exchange • ► Collaboration with industry for guest lectures from industry experts. • ► Faculty student ratio should not exceed 1:2 for post graduation courses. Curriculum and labs • ► Refer to Annexure 1 for details Industry and academic collaboration• Industry collaboration • Further collaboration with industry can be achieved by inviting companies to jointly conduct research on projects. This will allow these institutes to share cost, risk and expertise and IP with companies. • The patents can also be filed and co-owned by the company and institute’s research team. • Academic collaboration Collaboration should be done with universities/colleges, which teach advanced courses in semiconductor design such as IMEC-Belgium, VDEC-Japan and Cambridge University for student and faculty exchange programs. The institutes can also invite eminent professors from abroad especially of Indian origin who can act as mentors for students willing to do Ph.Ds in areas of their expertise. Learning and development activities• Employee training Training programs will be organized from time to time to equip employees with technical and management skills. • ► Short-term courses The institutes will organize seminars/workshops and offer short-term courses for skill development of academia and industry, which will be relevant for different levels of expertise. Management development program• ► Objective The program will equip design engineers with project management skills essential to manage the research projects efficiently and effectively. • Program • The institutes will offer a one-year executive Masters of Business Administration (MBA) on similar lines as “Visionary Leadership Program in Manufacturing” jointly offered by IIM Calcutta, IIT Kanpur and IIT Chennai. • The program will run with an aim to impart leadership and management skills together with cutting edge technology awareness to design professionals to produce next generation of techno-managerial leaders. • The program will be targeted to junior and middle-level management professionals of semiconductor design companies in India. 141 Section 3: Recommendations KarMic Training Center — a rural semiconductor initiative serving a social cause Semiconductor design for senior secondary graduates KarMic Training Center, located in Nesargi village, around 40 kilometers from Belgaum, Karnataka is a VLSI training institute started by Dr. Shivaling S Mahant Shetty in June 1999. The institute has been set up with an objective to offer specialized semiconductor design training to graduate engineers to make them industry-ready for the design sector. This center also provides similar training to senior secondary graduates from rural areas of Karnataka who may have not been able to pursue higher education due to financial constraints. The students are given a specialist training for a period of three years as a part of the “VLSI Junior Engineer” course. Major emphasis is on teaching students subjects specific to semiconductor design with a special focus on analog design. These students are given a practical exposure to design circuits on public domain tools available in computer laboratories. They learn to design chips used in mobile phones and other electronic gadgets. They also work on the projects obtained from semiconductor companies. The annual intake of the institute is 20 students. The students are selected from the academic institutes of the state after an elaborate selection process. They are paid a stipend of INR500 per month, half of which goes to their parents with the understanding that this money will be paid back by the students once they get employed. The first batch of the students will graduate next year. The model proposes the absorption of these graduates by the Karnataka Microelectronic Design Centre Pvt. Ltd., a company founded by Dr. Shetty. The success of this initiative has not just brought about a rural revolution by unearthing the potential of rural students in becoming future design engineers; it is also an excellent example of fulfillment of an individual’s social obligations by paying back what one has learnt from the society. Recommendation The government can attempt to achieve rural inclusion in the semiconductor revolution in India by replicating this kind of model and aid in enabling such set ups in tier-III cities and rural areas to encourage senior secondary and higher secondary graduates to take up a career in semiconductor design industry. Faculty can be encouraged to take up part-time/weekend courses in these setups.Management development program (cont’d.)• Program (cont’d.) • It will provide a right balance between theoretical inputs and practical training to develop high degree leadership skills. The program will offer professionals an international internship opportunity where they will work closely with industry leaders to gain hands-on experience at project management. • The institutes will collaborate with semiconductor industry associations of leading countries in semiconductor design such as the US, the UK, Germany and Taiwan to invite top management professionals from semiconductor companies of these countries to impart project management knowledge to Indian design professionals. Source: ISA—EY research 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry142 Create a pool of skilled labor for semiconductor design industry Apart from design engineers who are involved in R&D activities, semiconductor industry also needs skilled workforce to assist in areas related to VLSI testing activities, embedded services and hardware board design services. The government should consider setting up a for-profit organization through public private partnership (PPP) route on similar lines as National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) to fund development of skilled workforce for the semiconductor industry. This will be set up with an aim to bridge the existing gap between the demand and supply of skilled labor in the semiconductor industry. Both government and private players will be stakeholders in this venture and the funds will be contributed by both of them. The organization will work to establish vocational training centers to produce a skilled workforce. It will also provide funding to other companies that provide skills training. Alternatively, the government should include semiconductor as one of the sectors in its list of 21 identified sectors, which face a shortage of skilled workforce under NSDC. Other recommendations toward facilitating better quality of talent apply to the components of education and career advancement: Each one of these recommendations is discussed in detail below: Recommendation 1C - Cultivate student interest Area of concern: The semiconductor industry requires specialized skill sets preferably post graduates. However, the number of people pursuing post graduate degrees in India is a mere 8% of the total relevant engineering talent output in India. The average monthly stipend paid to an MTech student is INR 5,000 and that to a PhD student is about INR 9,500, which is far less than what a graduate earns in the industry. Recommendation: There should be an increased focus on promoting higher education at this level by ensuring that students and research fellows get better stipend and other performance-based incentives. This recommendation applies to students following the completion of higher studies. Post-graduate students, not just from tier-I colleges, should be offered attractive packages by the industry as compared to those offered to graduates. Awareness of semiconductor design as a good career option should be provided to the students by the academia. The GoI should provide incentives to companies willing to sponsor students for higher education.Improvement areaIn-depth recommendations elaborated Education 1C) Cultivate student interest 1D) Faculty development Career advancement1E) Plan employee advancement 143 Section 3: Recommendations Area of concern: Lack of readily deployable talent in the industry is seen as a big challenge. Generally, the industry provides support by donating EDA tools and equipment. However, there are only a few programs aimed at training the students on this software. Recommendation: Companies can help to bridge the gap by providing internships, organizing training programs and competitions in order to motivate students to use these tools. For example, some companies have introduced Analog Design contest in the past to encourage analog system design. Recommendation 1D - Faculty development Area of concern: The teaching profession in India does not necessarily attract good talent because of low remuneration, incentives and unattractive working conditions as compared to their counterparts in the industry or teachers abroad Recommendations: • Measures should be taken to increase salary bands and other benefits for faculty in order to attract quality talent. • ► New cadres of professors with more than 15 years of work experience in corporate or organization experience should be introduced on the lines of clinical professorship offered at some Ivy league institutes abroad • ► Faculty should be provided incentives such as establishment/endowment of research chairs and provision of fast track promotion schemes. Area of concern: Lack of continuous training opportunities for the Indian faculty to advance their own learning process Recommendations: • Engineering colleges should invest in providing training to its faculty in order to improve the quality of teaching especially in the areas of analog and mixed signal design as this is where lack of teaching expertise is cited. • ► Colleges can provide sabbaticals to their faculty members for higher education or to work on industry projects. • ► Educational institutions should forge collaborative ties for research with several leading international institutions, which are considered authorities on semiconductor design. • ► Companies should take initiatives such as organizing faculty development programs by inviting faculty members to work on live industry projects with a view to foster design skills and latest technology know-how among Indian faculty. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry144 Recommendation 1E - Plan employee advancement Area of concern: Fresh engineering graduates exhibit an increased attraction towards higher education as opposed to working during the initial years of their career and due to lack of opportunities provided by industry, it leads to unnecessary attrition. Recommendation: Companies can attract research-oriented talent by providing benefits such as sponsoring higher technical education (M.Tech, M.S., Ph.D etc.) and providing study leaves/sabbaticals to their employees to retain talent. Area of concern: Employees have a tendency to advance their career by moving away from the technical career toward management positions. Recommendation: Companies need to properly define the technical ladder in order to retain good talent in technical roles. Technically inclined people should be promoted to the position of a Fellow, which is a equivalent to a Vice-President and the salary differences are not significant. Issue 2: Absence of a startup and SMEs ecosystem Goal No. AddressedImprovement areaIn-depth recommendations elaborated 1, 3 Absence of a startup and SMEs ecosystemDemand side: Keep aside share of indigenous products in sectors of national importance Supply side: a. Provide avenues for seed and VC funding (Government and private) b. Setup VLSI specific incubation centers for incubation of startups and SMEs i. Incubation centers in STPI units ii. Incubation centers accessible to Tier-II engineering colleges c. Tax incentives Supply • Funding • VLSI incubation centers • Tax incentivesDemand Create market demand for indigenous semiconductor design companies 145 Section 3: Recommendations There is a need to manage/balance both the supply and demand side and it is imperative that there are interventions on both sides, in any market, to enable an industry to flourish. Much of the current policies in India emphasize on the supply side and hence, only providing supply side initiatives will not yield results as desired if there is no substantial market presence. As illustrated above, the government, industry and academia can come together to create a market demand for indigenous semiconductor design and products and on the other hand strengthen the supply side to encourage startups to be incubated in order to satisfy this created demand. In this section, recommendations have been provided to encourage more entrepreneurship activity and incubating semiconductor design startups. Demand side Keep aside share of indigenous products in sectors of national importance Recommendation: GoI should consider creating market demand, which will complement the supply side initiatives provided by them in order to encourage fabless companies to set shop. Three key areas of national importance need to be identified where indigenous preference can be given to sourcing of Indian semiconductor products. To begin with, 20% of IC content in these sectors, where GoI is the direct buyer, can be kept aside for products designed in India and this percentage can go up to 40% at a later stage for sectors such as Defense and Infrastructure. Some factors on which these sectors can be identified are the scale of potential demand, rapid pace of technology evolution, etc. Special tax initiatives can be unveiled for fabless companies who meet the market demand created. This will have the added advantage of giving rise to other ancillary areas of research in this space. Governments are themselves important buyers and suppliers of goods and services. However, only a handful of countries have signed on to WTO’s Government Procurement Agreement, notably, major emerging markets such as Brazil and China are not signatories, so their government purchases do not have to be open to foreign firms. Some suggested sectors that could be considered are (in alphabetical order): • Agriculture • ► Avionics • ► Clean energy • ► Defense • ► Education • ► Healthcare • ► Infrastructure India-specific products can be encouraged such as smart-meters used in energy, low-cost laptops, low-cost healthcare equipment, etc. Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry146 Supply side A. Provide avenues for seed and VC funding Though the venture capital firms are keen on investing in the Indian semiconductor design industry, currently there is very less investment activity seen by these players to the extent that investments in this space are not even tracked by any companies. Technology focus of VCs in India is more on the IT/ITeS service companies. Various reasons exist, some of them being — inability of the semiconductor companies to quickly grow in scale as compared to the IT/ITeS service companies, longer revenue realization period, higher initial investment, uncertainty over success of companies, etc. The semiconductor sector needs heavy investment and the cost of capital per employee is much higher compared to IT start-ups. It is estimated that the minimum funding requirement for a design startup firm with 15 employees is approximately INR30 million in the first year, going up to INR100 million in three years. The short-term value proposition brought onto the table by these start-ups is not attractive enough to draw investors. Hence these start-ups are mostly funded by angel investors. Suggested model and seed/VC investment required for that is: This makes a strong case for a government venture capital funding to encourage growth in this sector. Recommendations for the Indian scenario As shown in the exhibit below, start-ups require support in the business incubation period. In the Indian scenario, semiconductor startups are currently being funded mostly by angel investors and VC firms have adopted a more cautious approach. Hence there is a gap, which needs to be bridged by government support.Funding required for one design tape-out US$3–5 million per tape-out Total no. of companies to be targeted for incubation 50 Average hit-ratio for a semiconductor design company to succeed1:5 Number of companies with the potential to succeed and grow to US$200 million revenues10 companies Total investment required for incubating 50 companies US$150 –250 million Total investment required from government @50% of investment (with the rest 50% to be raised from VC firms)US$75 –125 million Source: ISA—EY research 2010 147 Section 3: Recommendations i) Government of India to collaborate with VC firms to provide early stage (pre- revenue) funding Considering that start-ups have a dependence on the government for early-stage financing, the GoI should invite large international VC firms and those which specialize particularly in seed funding to invest in the Indian semiconductor industry, in various focused sectors, as is the case seen in China and Singapore. The funds for this can be partly provided up to (50%) by the GoI and rest by private VCs and should be administered by private VCs. Private VCs are well-equipped to administer these funds as they bring in a wealth of technical and business expertise in dealing with semiconductor companies and also have good market connects, which are essentially very valuable for start-ups. The investment size should be kept relatively high keeping in view the higher funding requirements for a semiconductor design company. To understand the requirements and concerns of VCs, angel investors and term lenders toward providing seed funds, workshops/ road-shows need to be facilitated by the government where even semiconductor design startups can be invited.Expansion Growth Roll-out PrototypeInceptionGestationBusiness incubation periodExhibit 3: Recommendations for the Indian scenario Maturity IPO, Acquisition Banks VC firmsFounders Angel investors Source: ISA—EY research 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry148 ii) Government of India to collaborate with state VC funds iii) Provide cluster-specific funds • ► In order to mitigate risks, GoI should invest its available funds in the ratio of success of individual semiconductor clusters spread across India, such as Bangalore, NCR, Hyderabad, Pune and Chennai, since companies in these clusters already have proven capability in semiconductor design and have taken a lead in the Indian semiconductor story. The split of funds can be based on a similar ratio of success of various individual semiconductor clusters in terms of revenue/employment generated, in order to ensure replication of success due to availability of talent and knowledge know-how in these clusters. • ► Another criterion for distribution of funds can be to the companies focusing on sectors, which have evolved considerably in these clusters. For example, the aerospace sector in Bangalore or the automobile sector in Chennai.Contribution to state VC funds• Some states such as Karnataka have instituted a fund where the Karnataka government is expected to provide an amount of INR250 million, toward a 26% contribution to the KITVEN IT fund to assist start up semi-conductor units engaged in design and embedded software. The remaining funds are expected to come from the industry or mobilized through the PPP business model. • Discussion with international VC funds suggest that governments in other competitive countries invest a larger percentage of the fund and then invite international VC firms to fill in the rest of the lacunae. The GoI can play a role here by providing the additional amount or some part of it and raise the rest of it through industry. In this way other states can also be encouraged to form funds.Some famous established funds instituted by governments worldwide The Israeli venture community was instrumental in advising the Chinese to set up guidance funds, similar to Israel’s Yozma program in the early 1990s, in which the government invests as a limited partner in the local and foreign VC firms along with other institutional investors. It offered attractive tax incentives to any foreign venture capital investments in Israel and also offered to double any investment with funds from the government. As a result between 1991 and 2000, Israel’s annual venture capital outlays, nearly all private, rose nearly 60- fold, from US$58 million to US$3.3 billion; companies launched by Israeli venture funds went up from 100 to 800; and Israel’s information-technology revenues rose from US$1.6 billion to US$12.5 billion. The recently established Russian Venture Company (RVC) is doing the same to attract international brand name VC firms to Russia. 149 Section 3: Recommendations B. Setup VLSI specific incubation centers Two types of incubation center models are proposed: i. Incubation centers in STPI units ii. Incubation centers accessible to engineering colleges in Tier-II cities Criteria of selection of companies for incubation: Such companies can be identified by a neutral body after judging the research and commercial potential of the ventures, focusing on different market verticals proposed to be served by the startups and SMEs looking for incubation. Government’s support required for tool procurement: • To form an Incubation Center Committee (ICC) under the aegis of DIT to overlook the implementation of this program • To procure tools from tool vendors at highly subsidized costs and provide them to the start-ups and SMEs, which are incubated. In order to incentivize EDA tool companies, the government can make proceeds from tools as tax-free. Each of these incubation center models are further explained in detail below. i) Incubation centers in STPI units Recommendation: To build an ecosystem of semiconductor design start-ups and SMEs, governments should setup VLSI specific incubation centers in the four large semiconductor design clusters in India, in the cities of Bangalore, NCR, Hyderabad and Pune. Whereas existing incubation centers, which are present currently in STPI units/ academic institutions provide for basic physical infrastructure and connectivity, the VLSI specific incubation centers will provide physical infrastructure, connectivity and tools. The key characteristics of the incubation centers in STPI units are as follows: Size of centers ►The incubation centers should have a seating facility for 150 people and should not incubate more than 8–10 companies. Access to funds ►The STPI-region specific branches should be empowered to provide a single-window access for clearance to facilitate hassle-free and timely access to funds to companies looking to be incubated. VLSI-specific facilities required►In addition to the usual incubation center facilities, these VLSI-specific centers will require the presence of VLSI design labs and access to various design tools. Payback of funds ►Instead of charging the incubated companies the full cost for the facilities provided, a nominal charge plus an equity share of the incubated company should be provided to the incubation center. Promotion of fabless companies►A central facility with the presence of characterization, failure analysis or qualification lab facilities should be provided by the government, which can be utilized by all the companies present in the incubation centers. Source: ISA—EY research 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry150 ii) Incubation centers accessible to engineering colleges in Tier-II cities Government should consider setting up incubation centers accessible to engineering colleges in Tier-II cities. These centers will provide a symbiotic ecosystem for design start-ups and SMEs, faculty and students. These will provide start-ups with necessary infrastructure facilities and ready access to talent, giving them a platform to launch their operations. The start-ups will contribute in terms of training students and faculty on latest design tools. Identification of engineering colleges in Tier-II cities: The colleges can be shortlisted on the basis of: • One way is to adopt the participating colleges in Tier-II cities as mentioned in the SMDP • Existing level of industry interaction with the college. This would help in selection of those colleges, which are above a minimum level in terms of inviting companies to the campus for placements, delivering guest lectures and conducting workshops. • Quality of faculty in these colleges, judged on the basis of experience in teaching semiconductor design and number of research papers published Setting up incubation center facilities can be quite a complex operation involving multiple stakeholders working together. Following are the key stakeholders identified for this initiative: • Start-up and SME design companies • Students • Faculty • Government Following table lists the roles and benefits available to all the stakeholders. Stakeholder Roles Benefits Start-up companies and SMEs• ► To train students and faculty on latest design tools. • ► To provide students and faculty with an opportunity to work on live projects and take up internships with them.• ► Incubation facilities: Due to lack in availability of funds from venture capitals, start-ups require an atmosphere for incubation. These incubation centers will provide the necessary infrastructure such as office and laboratory space as well as power at a highly subsidized rate, which will lower their initial set-up cost. They will also get access to latest design tools procured by the government at highly subsidized costs. 151 Section 3: Recommendations • Access to talent: Design start-ups face challenge in hiring engineering graduates from colleges in tier-I colleges as majority of design talent opt for well- established MNCs in design space. This model will help them to attract quality talent from engineering colleges in Tier-II cities where they are likely to establish their operations. • ► Reduction of deployment time: There will be a substantial reduction in their training costs for the fresh engineers as the students will receive training during their engineering tenure making them ready for the industry. • Leverage on faculty: Companies can leverage the skills of the faculty in these colleges by engaging in long-term R&D projects with them. • Employee satisfaction: As these incubation centers will be set up in the vicinity of engineering colleges in different parts of the country, the design engineers can opt for working for these companies established near their hometowns. This will help start-ups in attracting quality design professionals and reducing attrition rate. Students • Involvement in design-related research activities • Internship with design start- ups. • To work on live projects with design companies• ► The students will get hands-on experience on live projects by working with latest design tools used in the industry. • ► Creation of an opportunity to get employed with the start-ups and SMEs after undergoing an extensive training during and after their graduation. Faculty • To work closely with start-ups to conduct research.• ► Faculty will benefit from the industry interaction by working closely with design start-ups and SMEs on various projects. This will result in a continuing education opportunity for them as they will get to refresh their skills and update their knowledge while working on latest design tools. • ► Opportunity for faculty to obtain paid consulting projects from start-ups and SMEs. Government • To identify potential engineering colleges in tier-2 cities for setting up incubation centers.• Talent growth: The colleges in the vicinity of incubation centers will produce highly trained and design industry-ready manpower equipped with all the relevant skills. Thus the government will have to spend less amount of money to set-up facilities in colleges such as under SMDP to produce skilled design engineers. • Equity stake: Government may consider having equity stake in some of these start-ups, which can later be sold and the profits obtained can be used to fund other start-ups. Source: ISA—EY research 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry152 C. Tax incentives Direct tax benefits • Tax deduction for R&D companies could be on a graded scale, based on the percentage of revenues that they spend on R&D. A higher percentage will mean that the complexity of the product R&D is higher and hence, it is expected to have higher value-addition and also a longer gestation period • ► Exemption from levy of minimum alternate tax (MAT) for a period of five years, so that they can use the extra cash generated from tax savings to reinvest in R&D. Indirect tax benefits • ► Extension of service tax exemption to STPI and EOU units similar to that for SEZ units • ► Abolition of Special Additional Duty (SAD) on all electronic products and components used by the semiconductor industry for a period of 5 years — similar to the present concession for the parts/components/accessories to manufacture mobile handsets, including cellular phones, introduced in the Union Budget 2011 • ► The GoI could consider exempting semiconductor units set up outside SEZs from the levy of countervailing duties (CVD). Others incentives • Stamp duties: Exemption from stamp duties paid with respect to loan agreements, credit deeds, mortgage and hypothecation deeds executed for availing term loans from financial institutions notified by the GoI for an initial period of five years. Further, exemption from payment of stamp duties could also be granted for lease deeds, lease-cum-sale deeds for units set up in areas notified by the central /state government for an initial period of five years. Registration charges could also be lowered for loan documents, sale deeds, etc.; • ► Entry tax: State governments could consider exempting entry tax on plant and machinery and capital goods for an initial period of five years from the date of commencement of projects. Further, entry tax should also be exempt for raw materials, components and consumables (apart from petroleum products) for an initial period of 5 years from the date of commencement of commercial production; • Interest free loan on VAT: Interest free loan on VAT could be provided by state governments depending on the quantum of investments and strength of work force in the units. 153 Section 3: Recommendations Issue 3: Lack of a semiconductor ecosystem Competitive countries in the semiconductor industry have a mature and very well-developed semiconductor ecosystem, which in turn, enables growth of the semiconductor industry. Discussions with industry players also suggest that the cost arbitrage advantage enjoyed by India today, may not always last and the growth of the semiconductor industry in India may be muted if the other areas of the semiconductor value-chain such as ATMP and semiconductor manufacturing are not tapped into. Recommendations: The detailed recommendation for a strong ecosystem development is: Recommendation 3A: Promote fabless semiconductor model Fabless refers to the business methodology of outsourcing the manufacturing of silicon wafers, whereas they focus on the design, development and marketing of their products and form alliances with silicon wafer manufacturers, or foundries. With process technology being viewed as commoditized and unable to provide a competitive advantage with the exception of memory, continuing down the integrated device manufacturer path was proving to be filled with challenges for many companies and hence, the shift over the last decade was seen toward fabless companies worldwide. There is now a trend seen toward fabless companies moving gradually toward Asia, due to large sustainable markets as well as the presence of foundries in this region. Area of concern: India with its large availability of talent pool in the design industry, presence of a market for region-specific products in the clean energy, rural and healthcare sectors and Indian companies are being better equipped to provide high-quality software as compared to its Asian competitors, make a strong case for the rise of the fabless industry. But the growth in the number of indigenous fabless semiconductor companies in India is not as expected. Apart from a very handful number of players, rest of the industry is heavily skewed toward design, resulting in government policies aimed to provide investments and incentives to the design industry. Indian fabless companies can be defined as, companies with a combination of both, parent entity registered in India and with more than 75% of its design workforce operating out of India. This can be further debated and defined by the government.Goal No. AddressedImprovement areaIn-depth recommendations elaborated 1 Ecosystem development3A) Promote fabless semiconductor model – build on expertise achieved in the services industry to promote semiconductor products designed in India Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry154 Recommendations: • Unveiling policy similar to STPI policy for incubating fabless semiconductor companies Fabless companies selling ICs avail tax benefits in India under EHTP and not STPI. But these benefits are availed only if there is any further value-add from India, post manufacturing. Since these companies ship ICs, manufactured abroad, directly to the end customer, they are not provided exemption. Recommendations: Either of the following initiatives can be taken: • Design should be conceived as the value-add and likewise STPI policy can be updated to reflect this • Fabless companies should be extended STPI such as benefits following the potential STPI policy expiry this year as moving into a SEZ may not be financially viable for a fabless semiconductor company, which is less people intensive. • Setting up of characterization, failure analysis and qualification lab Fabless companies in the startup phase are not able to setup these labs in-house as they are very cost intensive and hence these ICs need to be sent abroad, which is time consuming and hence a big disadvantage for Indian fabless companies. The cost of setting up a characterization lab alone can be more than US$ 1.5 million plus maintenance costs.

Since the fabless industry itself is in a nascent stage in India, there are not many good quality labs unlike other countries. Hence the government needs to provide 50% of the total cost towards purchase of proposed equipment while setting up the following labs. The remaining funds can come from the industry or mobilized through the PPP business model. Other recommendations towards building an ecosystem which is conducive for the growth of the Indian semiconductor industry are: Each one of these recommendations is discussed in detail below. Recommendation 3B - Promote currently existing semiconductor clusters and develop new clusters According to CII, 60% of India’s overall exports come from units in clusters, making it one of the key drivers of economic growth. With close to 80% of the companies in the semiconductor space having a presence in Bangalore, NCR, Pune and Hyderabad regions, there is a case for the region around these cities to be promoted as hubs of leading-edge semiconductor capabilities, research and development. Promoting clusters has various advantages — increasing competitiveness, sharing of semiconductor knowledge, ease of sourcing of components and ready availability of funding. The concept of semiconductor clusters worldwide is slightly different in the context of India as India lacks the manufacturing foundries, which are an integral part of worldwide semiconductor clusters. The foundries are replaced by semiconductor design companies in India. Globally also the definition of semiconductor clusters has expanded to include the ecosystem, which is present within the periphery of hundreds of miles instead of a single campus. Recommendations • The government should establish institutes specialized in semiconductor research similar to the Indian Institute of Nano Science (IINS) being setup in Bangalore, Mohali and Kolkata and other colleges with specialization in semiconductor related engineering streams in proximity to the clusters in order to facilitate the industry academia interaction and collaboration. Taiwanese government developed Hsinshu park is close to two of Taiwan’s oldest universities giving it the advantage of skilled labor supply and low employee training costs.Improvement areaIn-depth recommendations elaborated Absence of a startup and SMEs ecosystem3B) Promote currently existing semiconductor clusters and develop new clusters Tapping other components of the ecosystem3C) Encourage and promote ATMP 3D) Support dedicated foundries to create devices meeting local demand Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry156 • Semiconductor companies need a strong supply of components and hence component sourcing companies should be encouraged to setup shop in these clusters to ease sourcing required for board/ hardware design in required quantities and time • To increase collaboration and business opportunities, there needs to be increased cooperation with industry clusters which source semiconductors, like electronic clusters • New clusters can be developed around a port city such as Chennai or Vizag. The advantage of a port city is vast availability of water and treatment plants. Sourcing of components and logistics are also a non-issue due to the presence of ports. Power plants can be setup within the vicinity of these clusters and these clusters can be given SEZ status to encourage investments in them. Famous semiconductor cluster examples “Silicon Fen”, as the cluster is popularly known as, is located in the Cambridge region of East England. In 1980s, this cluster produced more patents per capita than the UK average. Proximity to the University of Cambridge has been a major reason for the development of this cluster. High-tech companies located in the cluster collaborate with related departments in the university for R&D activities by setting up research laboratories there. Easy access to finance is another important factor for development of this cluster. Venture capital firms and local intermediaries provide financial assistance to the firms in the cluster. Another case in point is Hsinshu park — a technology park that houses research centers, companies and universities within a single campus to promote for a healthy interaction. Recommendation 3C - Encourage and promote ATMP The ATMP stage completes the last link of the semiconductor value chain. Though currently this industry is very small and in its nascent state in India, with more captives outsourcing ATMP activities to ATMP units in India and the setting up of domestic testing and packaging companies, this industry has a vast potential to grow. Recommendations • Testing being a logical extension to design services and considered to be an industry worth multi- billion US dollars, governments should make additional provisions to encourage and incentivize companies to set up testing units in India. Labs involved in testing and certifications should be incentivized by government to set shop or companies can join hands to fund setting up of more common testing and certification facilities to service all their needs. • Revision of the tax structure and allocation of special ATMP zones in the proximity of ports will also aid in building this ecosystem. • The threshold limit for availing incentives for ATMP units of US$ 250 million under the Semiconductor Policy of Government of India, 2007, appears to be very high for ATMPs and merits a review to reduce this threshold to above US$ 100 million and up to US$ 250 million as proposed in the Karnataka state policy. 157 Section 3: Recommendations Recommendation 3D - Support dedicated foundries to create devices meeting local demand Area of concern: India cannot compete with Taiwan or China on the leading node since it involves significant investments to the tune of multi-billion US$ and technical know- how, which these countries have gained over the past 20 years. India also faces issues in supporting foundry operations since there are infrastructural challenges such as uninterrupted water and power supply, easy access to ports etc. Recommendations • ► The options that can be explored are, creating foundries at “second-to-last” or “third-to- last” technology nodes probably at 90 nm or 120 nm, which require far less investment and can cater to local demand in select verticals such as industrial automation, consumer segment, etc. The large local demand, as well as proximity to customers, will ensure growth of such foundries and make movement of such units to other geographies less likely. • ► Another option, which can be explored is creating foundries for analog and mixed signal technology. These foundries at 180 nm/130 nm are contemporary to worldwide analog and mixed signal foundries, cost-effective and meet global demands. An added advantage to this, considering that design is the mainstay of the Indian semiconductor industry, is that it may fuel the growth of analog and mixed design industry in India as the design content in these technologies is of higher value than digital technology. Issue 4: Lack of adequate infrastructure, implementable incentives and policies, including IP protection and R&D ecosystem The investors look up to the government for commitment to the development of the industry through equity participation, fiscal incentives and support infrastructure development. Recommendations: Recommendations to address the issue of lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and implementable incentives are: Each one of these recommendations is discussed in detail below.Goal No. AddressedImprovement areaIn-depth recommendations elaborated 2, 4 Providing direct assistance4A) Protect and promote intellectual property 4B) Provision of R&D funding initiatives for academia and industry 1 Providing indirect assistance4C) Provide infrastructure support Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry158 Recommendation 4A - Protect and promote intellectual property IP offences such as trade secret theft, patent infringement and counterfeiting in the semiconductor space in India are lower as compared to its Asian counterparts such as China, Taiwan and Korea. The GoI has adopted a unique and exhaustive set of legislations for intellectual property in India in line with its prevailing socio-economic and political factors. Customers favor India for its relatively strong IP protection policies as compared to other Asian countries. The favorable opinion of customers of semiconductor companies toward IP protection in India can be further leveraged by the GoI and industry adopting some best practices and creating/possessing intellectual property. The focus now needs to shift to the next level where concentrated attention on promotion of innovation. These recommendations call for the government, industry and researchers to work together to improve the quality and standard of innovation and its application in India. The following table describes various opportunities to foster innovation in the semiconductor space: Create • ► Encourage Indian entities to develop IP Entities involved: Companies, government research labs etc Recommendation: • Created in India: The GoI can continue with its program for financial assistance of 50% of patent costs instituted through DIT, through a few changes to the policy to facilitate better access to funds: • Grants can be forwarded not just to SMEs or start-ups, but to large companies also based on the merit of innovation • Filing procedures • Reduce the high cycle time for processing patent reimbursement applications applied currently • ► Set up monthly/quarterly sessions for application hearings • ► Set up local/zone-wise offices instead of only a centralized office in Delhi, to reduce travel costs and time for applicants • ► Encourage companies to present more than one application, if it is the case, per meeting Criteria: An exclusive project funding process to be established and administered by the GoI. These can be granted to government or private companies based on the application’s merit and valuation by an approved IP valuation committee. Some part of this fund should be expected to come back to the government, based on the success of the venture, in the case of for-profit ventures. 2. Buy • Encourage IP ownership by Indian entities Entities involved: Companies, government research labs etc. Recommendation: Owning IP is more important to creating value for businesses than just motivating innovation. Incentives need to be given to Indian entities to acquire intellectual property via different means: • Foreign company acquisition • Foreign patent acquisition Criteria: Government incentives will be based on business case justification approved by IP experts. An Ideal situation is when the applicant is able to establish relevance of the patent to a product that the applicant exports to the said foreign country or the product has a large market in India. 159 Section 3: Recommendations Other recommendations towards protecting and promoting intellectual property are provided below: Protecting intellectual property Area of concern: Generate awareness about India’s legislative and administrative framework amongst holders about protecting their rights and amongst industry about deceiving others of their intellectual property rights and the consequences. Recommendations : • Industry along with the various forms of government should conduct series of workshops/awareness programs, on line of those conducted by CII in collaboration with state governments, to discuss challenges/issues faced by the IP right holders, due consideration can then be given while framing new laws • Companies should conduct regular training sessions for employees to improve awareness and imbibe strong IP protection measures, provide for a ‘cool-off’ period between projects of similar nature for different competitors and conduct audits for all projects to ensure uniqueness of design and patent protection Promoting intellectual property Area of concern: One of the key challenges in the embedded software industry is to keep pace with the current technology node which changes every 18-24 months while providing increased functionality at the same or lower cost. Recommendations: • Companies need to start investing in building libraries, so as to modularize code which can then be reused at a later stage for providing similar functionality. Thus with rapid hardware changes, costs can be controlled by utilizing lesser effort due to reusable code to provide increased functionality by the software. The advantage of investing to convert this reusable code to IP is to unlock and generate another revenue stream for the company by offering IP-based solutions. • Industry should collaborate with academia for conducting research in the development of common testing platforms and frameworks to enable easy integration of third-party software IPs into custom chip development3. Encourage academic R&D• Encourage Indian Universities to do international quality research Recommendations: • Incentivize academic researchers to obtain publications in international journals such as IEEE and conference participation as part of the PhD evaluation process in India. • Provide special incentives to support researchers and research students for patent applications as per criteria given in #1 above. • Provide special tax incentives to companies willing to set up lab facilities at research institutions Source: ISA—EY research 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry160 Recommendation 4B – Provision of R&D funding initiatives for academia and industry Semiconductor technology is growing at a rapid pace and to keep pace with it, the Indian semiconductor industry R&D system should be improved. A. R&D funding initiatives for academia The government should consider setting up an R&D fund for the following academia related activities: B. R&D funding initiatives for industry The government should consider setting up an R&D fund for the following industry related activities:Improvement of laboratory infrastructure in top 45 engineering colleges• SMDP covers 7 Resource Centers and 25 PIs. • ► In order to enhance the output of engineers relevant for semiconductor design, laboratory infrastructure for other top engineering colleges, which fall outside the gambit of SMDP, needs to be improved. • ► This program needs to be extended to 11–13 more engineering colleges by 2012 by equipping them with faculty and infrastructure to meet the demand for semiconductor design engineers by 2012. Participation assistance for international conferences/ workshops• Grant The government should continue to encourage participation of semiconductor design faculty across engineering colleges in international conferences and workshops. The government should sponsor up to 75% of their travel expenses and 50% of the conference registration fee (if any). Criteria for grant • This incentive should be made available to all the faculty members who have published at least two papers in the preceding two years in area of semiconductor design in referred magazines/journals of international reputation such as IEEE. • In exceptional cases, where the research work has the potential to be filed as a patent, 100% of travel and registration fee exemption is proposed. Funding for research projects undertaken by students and institutes• ► A council should be set-up by the DIT to identify good individual research projects undertaken by MTech/ PhD scholars and projects undertaken at institute level. Depending upon the complexity of the project and the potential idea, the funding should range from INR0.1 million to INR2 million. This funding can be partly provided by the DIT and partly sponsored by the industry Source: ISA—EY research 2010 R&D fund • The GoI should setup a semiconductor fund of excellence to provide funds to encourage private companies, who undertake R&D activities for India-specific products designed in India. • The fund should cover 50% of R&D costs, including people-related costs, toward R&D activities. • The effort made toward R&D by companies should be evaluated by an expert panel of academicians, top Indian leaders from Indian firms and MNCs, as well as invited talent from abroad to oversee policy implementation. • Based on the evaluations, an award can be constituted for the best R&D project undertaken by companies in the semiconductor design space. Source: ISA—EY research 2010 161 Section 3: Recommendations Recommendation 4C - Provide infrastructure support Unavailability of adequate infrastructure reduces the attractiveness of India as a manufacturing destination. As compared to China, India’s infrastructure is in a poor condition. The gap between the two countries is widening every year with China investing 20% of its GDP in infrastructure as compared with India’s 6%. These infrastructural challenges make doing business in India difficult. Area of concern: India is a power-deficient nation and demand-supply mismatch is around 7%. Cost of electricity in India is high as compared to other countries in the benchmarking study except Germany. Recommendations: • ► The GoI should invest in developing more power plants and should encourage and incentivize more private players to enter this sector and set-up power projects. Power generation set-ups and distribution networks need to be improved in order to minimize losses. • ► The quality of power to be supplied to manufacturing units should be uninterrupted and of a steady frequency and voltage • ► The government should provide subsidies in electricity prices similar to those provided in the Karnataka Semiconductor policy to new business set-ups to help them reduce their operational costs and become profitable soon. These subsidies can be removed after the businesses become profitable. Area of concern: The semiconductor industry requires world-class logistics infrastructure for inbound material and outbound finished products to be shipped globally. India’s ports today are already at saturation point and container capacities are almost completely utilized. Recommendations: • ► This requires upgrading of Indian ports and setting up of a clean room supply chain to handle high-tech electronic components and raw material. • ► The government needs to make public investment in additional capacities, invite privatization of operations and further reduce customs clearance times to one or two days (as has China) from the current one or two weeks. In addition to the above recommendations, some other infrastructure incentives which can be adopted as best practices from China are: • ► Under a “virtual fab” strategy adopted by some local governments, construction of a fabrication plant is fully or largely funded by the government but is managed by contracted private firms under a profit-sharing agreement. • ► Another instance is, that of The Pudong New Area in Shanghai, which refunds land use fees and subsidizes property taxes for pre-approved R&D centers, under the Pudong technology development fund Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry162 Issue 5: External issues affecting the Indian semiconductor industry Area of concern: Sustenance of India’s growth momentum against increased competition from low-cost Asian countries Recommendations: • ► Unveil new India-specific policies aimed at other industries, which utilize semiconductors as sub-components. This will encourage more R&D in the semiconductor space in India in order to adhere to these policies, thereby converting them into local market opportunities. An example is the environmental protection policy in the form of Bharat norms introduced by the government for the automobile industry in India. • ► The industry should begin to move away from the standard fixed FTE-based or time and material business models and adopt innovative non-linear business models (outcome- based). Output is not directly proportional to inputs in these models and pricing is not calculated based on costs rather on the markets appetite. The industry should also invest in more automation and reusability of code as well as develop IP-based solutions. These steps can aid in reducing costs, improve efficiency and increase revenues to help maintain India’s position vis-à-vis competition. Roadmap for recommendations implementation Provided in Exhibit 5 below is an indicative roadmap for all the articulated recommendations to be implemented in order to aid the Indian semiconductor industry tap into its complete potential. The timeline for recommendations is to be read as: 0-12 months 13-24 months >24 monthsShort term Medium term Long term0-12 months 13-24 months >24 monthsShort term Medium term Long term0-12 months 13-24 months >24 monthsShort term Medium term Long termRecommendations, which begin in this period are extremely essential for the industry to grow in the near future, comparatively easier to implement and ensure quick wins to achieve results in the shortest time possible. Recommendations, which begin in this period are essential to sustain the momentum of the Indian semiconductor industry and are moderately difficult to implement. They have the potential to leapfrog the industry into its next growth phase. Recommendations, which begin in this period are quite essential for the Indian semiconductor industry to tap into other growth areas of the semiconductor value chain. These recommendations involve coordination and cooperation between multiple stakeholders and hence involve considerable lead time. 163 Section 3: Recommendations A point to be noted is that all the recommendations proposed are activities which are to be are ongoing and continuous and hence extend beyond the period of their respective terms.Now *Highlighted recommendations are detailed recommendations12 months 24 months Issue 1: Quality, availability and maturity of talent Issue 3: Lack of a semiconductor ecosystem Issue 4: Lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and implementable incentivesCultivate student interest Protect and promote intellectual property Provision of R&D funding initiatives for academia and industry Provide infrastructure supportPromote currently existing semiconductor clusters and develop new clusters Encourage and promote ATMP Support dedicated foundries to create devices meeting local demandShort Term Medium Term Long Term Plan employee advancementFaculty development Issue 5: External issuesAdopt non -linear business modelsIssues Set up specialized institutes for semiconductor design Issue 2: Build a startup and SMEs ecosystemDemand & Supply side initiatives Promote fabless semiconductor modelExhibit 5: Roadmap of recommendations Source: ISA—EY research 2010 Study on semiconductor design, embedded software and services industry164 Addressal of challenges with stakeholder responsibility In conclusion, Exhibit 6 below summarizes the main issues that the Indian semiconductor industry faces, the key challenges associated with each issue and the corresponding recommendation proposed for each issue.

        "content": "ONE YEAR OF MODI 2.0 Towards a Self -Relian t India Government of India The Country and the World is going through an unpr eceden ted crisis owing to COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020. Na\u0000ons across the Globe have gone into lockdown and people are struggling to find ways to fight the disease and its spread. Even as social distancing and chang e of lifestyles became a new normal, India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendr a Modi is one of the first countries to put up a concerted, compr ehensiv e ac\u0000on plan to stop the spread of the virus and limit the number of COVID-19 infec\u0000ons.India put in every effort to convert the crisis into an opportunity . It went into a mode of self-relianc e and sprung into ac\u0000on to become “Aatmanirbhar” . Interna \u0000onal Organisa \u0000ons like the WHO have praised the efforts made by the Indian Governmen t to fight the pandemic. India is one of the few countries which announced a complete Lockdown even before the number of the COVID cases in the country were less than 500. When the Corona crisis started, there was not a single PPE kit made in India. The N-95 masks were produc ed in small quan \u0000\u0000es in India. Today we are in a posi\u0000on to produc e 2 lakh PPE and 2 lakh N-95 masks daily . We were able to do this because India turned this crisis into an opportunity . This vision of India - turning crisis into opportunity- is going to prove equally effec\u0000v e for our resolv e of self-relian t India. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendr a Modi the ci\u0000zens demonstr ated their full commitmen t in preven\u0000ng the spread of COVID-19.Towards this direc\u0000on the Prime Minister announc ed a 20 Lakh Crore Rupee S\u0000mulus packag e, which is about 10% of GDP , in order to boost the econom y and sustain the growth.

Projected Industry Size and Human Resource Requirements 2.5.1. Projected Size and Human Resource Requ irement of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Our analysis reveals that the Electronics and IT Hardware industry has the potential to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 17% till 2022 and even thereafter considering the fact that the GDP is exp ected to grow at a rate of 7.5% to 8% over this period19. Therefore, we expect the production of Electronics and IT Hardwa re to increase from Rs. 844 billion in 2008 to Rs. 7,520 billion by 2022. Consumer Electronics, Co mputers, Telecom Equipment, and Industrial Electronics would contribute to a large portion of the size of the industry. 19 Our overall approach to macro-ec onomic modeling and for ecasting is explained in a separate annexure Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 42 of 49 Table 19: Production in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry in India Size of Electronics and IT Hardware Industry (Rs. billion) 2008 2012 2018 2022 CAGR Electronics and IT Hardware Industry in India 844 1,636 4,300 7,521 17% Consumer Electronics 226 399 946 1,474 14% Others (Industrial Electronics) 119 234 650 1,380 19% Computers 159 260 852 1,546 18% Telecom Equipment 187 478 1,338 1,354 15% Strategic Electronics 57 125 344 714 20% Components 96 140 171 1,053 19% Source: IMaCS analysis This would translate to the overall employment in the industry increasing from the current level of 0.9 million to over 4 million by 2022. This would translate to an incremental human resource requirement of about 3 million to 3.2 million.

Skill Pyramid for the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Given that the industry would required a varied prof ile of skill sets, the following figure presents an overview of the profile of skill requirements as de rived from human resource requirements across different sectors of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 45 of 49 Figure 22: Skill Pyramid for the Elect ronics and IT Hardware Industry Source: Industry inputs, IMaCS analysis The skill pyramid, in summary, captures where th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry stands relatively in terms of skills (a function of ac tivity, educational requirements, and amount of ‘preparatory’ time required to inculcate a specifi c skill) as compared to all other industries. As can be observed, ‘Skill Levels 2 and 3’ , have the highest incremental requirement of human resource. This indicates the requirement for persons trained in manufacturing, servicing, and sales functions in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. 2.6. Emerging Trends in Electronics and IT Hardware Industry and Implications on Human Resource and Skill Requirements The following are some of the emerging trends in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry:  Increasing consumption and potential for production: The expected stead y increase in the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFC E) on Home Appliances, Recreational and Education Services, both ranging between 13% and 15%, is expected to drive the consumption and production of Electronics and IT Hardware. This is expected to drive industry/production growth at about 17%, w ith major contributors being Computers, Consumer Electronics, and Telecom.  Sales and Service Ecosystem as a driver of employment: The sales and service support functions are expected to generate an incr emental employment of 1.2 million persons till 4% to 5% Skill Level 4 (skills which are highly specialised involving research and design) Skill Level 3 (skills which require long drawn preparation as demonstrated by acquisition of degrees, and involve highly technical or il i ) Skill Level 2 (skills which require technical training inputs, knowledge of complex operations and machinery, skills of supervision) Skill Level 1 (skills which can be acquired with a short/modular and focussed intervention and thereby enhancing employability of those with minimal education) 49% to 50% 25% to 27% 19% to 21% Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 46 of 49 2022. This would be due to a large nation-wi de footprint of tier-2 and tier-3 industry participants (dealers, franchisees, service agenci es, etc.). This ‘ecosystem’ would contribute to a large portion of the human resource requirement.  Manufacturing has potential for increasing localisation: While a large portion of manufacturing is actually currently a combination of sourcing and assembly, increasing content would be locally manufactured – for example, passive components, certain active components, more complex motherboards, increasing adoption of Surface Mounted Technologies and other high-tech areas. Certai n components such as CRT based picture tubes may eventually see a reduction in production given the increasing adoption of LCD/Plasma displays. Incremental employment in manufacturing is likely to be 1.5 million till 2022.  Increasing adoption of E-Waste Management (electronic waste management) driven by regulation is likely to see more ‘organi sation’ of the industry in that space.  Global trends such as green and energy efficient t echnology is likely to have increasing adoption in India too.  Increasing contract manufacturing an d stronger OEM-supplier relationships would also be a key success factor towards developing a bette r ecosystem. There is a strong case for cluster development in this sector.  Growing segments would be major contributors to employment: Segments such as Consumer Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecom Equipment would be major contributors for employment. Illustrative growth categories are: • Set Top Boxes • Mobile Handsets • Plasma/LCD TVs • PC assembly • End to End IT solutioning - assembling, inst allation, support at on-site and off-site, infrastructure management, emergence of newer technologies such as cloud-computing. 2.7.

Background and Objective 1.1 The Digital India Programme envisions transforming India into a Digitally empowered society and knowledge economy by making available digital infrastructure, digital governance and digital services to every citizen. Promotion of a digital payments ecosystem is a natural extension of the Digital India programme and has the potential to transform India’s economy by formalization of financial transactions. 1.2 Financial inclusion is one of the f oremost challenges for India Digital payments promises access to formal financial services and benefits from e -commerce, especially for those who continue to be excluded. Despite significant progress in bank -led payment systems, there remained a vast gap i n the availability of basic payment services. Adoption of technology can transform the country into a cashless economy. 1.3 Finance Minister in his Budget Speech on February 1, 2017 had announced “a target of 2,500 crore digital transaction for 2017 -18 throug h UPI, USSD, Aadhaar Pay, IMPS and debit cards.” 1.4 In the digital payments ecosystem, merchants play a very crucial role especially in country like India where nearly 90% of merchants are unorganized like small grocery stores, local apparels outlets, mom -n-pop stores and more. Apart from these, the daily small time merchants like local vendors, auto/taxi drivers etc., constitute of large share of unorganized merchants. To promote BHIM amongst merchants the Merchant Cashback Scheme is being launched. 1.5 The schem e aims to incentivize not just one -time adoption of BHIM by merchants, but should also encourage transactions via BHIM mode (either QR code or VPA or Mobile number or “Pay to Aadhaar”).

Eligibility Criteria for Merchant 3.1 Defined Transaction Criteria for Merchants to qualify for cashback are: a. Min of 50 credit financial trans actions of which atleast 20 transactions is from valid UPI unique customers including that of BHIM users. b.
