According to the State of Indias Digital Economy Report 2024, India is the third largest digitalised country in the world in terms of economy-wide digitalisation and 12th among the G20 countries in the level of digitalisation of individual users. Yet, there are no credible and up-to-date estimates on the contribution of the digital economy to national income and employment. Quantifying and understanding the role of the digital economy in driving economic growth, employment, and sustainable development are essential for both policymakers and the private sector. This can help align resources and adopt appropriate growth strategies. However, the cross-cutting and integrated nature of digital technologies makes the concept of a distinct digital economy difficult to define and measure. Moreover, the conventional system of national accounts does not lend itself directly to the measurement of the new economy. The problem is not unique to India. Few countries have attempted to size up their digital economy and even these efforts are works in progress. This report uses globally adopted methodologies frameworks developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)to estimate the size of Indias digital economy, both as a share of national income and total employment. With the publication of these numbers, India will be among a handful of countries, and the first among developing countries, to have used the OECD framework to produce the most up-to-date estimate for the size of its digital economy. The report goes beyond the OECD approach to also include the digital share of traditional industries like trade, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and education. Our estimates are based on a triangulation of data from multiple sources, including data published by the national 1 The estimates in this report are for 2022-23, which is the latest year for which disaggregated national accounts data are available.Executive Summary accounts division (NAD) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) database, CMIE Prowess, Tracxn, Employees Provident Fund Organisations Establishment Search portal, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), and various market studies, industry reports, and compa ny annual reports. In addition, we u ndertook a survey, held focus-group discussions, and consulted extensively with industry experts a nd company officials while preparing this report. We estimate that Indias digital economy stood at 11.74% of the national income in 2022-23 and is likely to rise to 13.42% by 2024-25.1 In absolute numbers, the digital economy in 2022-23 w as equivalent to INR 28.94 lakh crore (USD 368 billion) in GVA and INR 31.64 lakh crore ( USD 402 billion) in GDP. While the traditional ICT sector remains the largest component of the digital economy, digital platforms and the digitalisation of brick-and-mortar sectors are growing rapidly. The digitally enabling industry, which includes sectors such as information and communication related services, telecommunication (traditionally referred to as the ICT sector), and manufacturing of electr onic components, computers, and communication equipment, is the highest contributor, accounting for 7.83% of GVA. The new digital industries, which include Big Tech players, other digital platforms and intermediaries, and firms depend ent on digital intermediaries, account for nearly 2% of GVA. The digital contribution of three traditional industries (BFSI, trade, and education), which are not part of the OEC D framework but are included in our estimates, amounts to 2% of national GVA, rivalling in importance to the new digital industries. This is a clear indication that Indias digital economy is stead ily moving beyond the realm of the ICT industries, diffus ing across all parts of the economy through digital platforms and the digitalisation of brick-and-mortar sectors. 14  Based on our projections, Indias digital economy is expected to grow almost twice as fast as the overall economy, contributing to near ly one-fifth of national income by 2029-30. This means that, in less than six-years, the share of digital economy will become larger than that of agriculture or manufacturing in the coun try. In the short run, the highes t growth is likely to come from the growth of digi tal intermediaries and platforms, followed by higher digital diffusion and digitalisation of the rest of the economy. This will eventually lower the share of digitally enabling ICT industries in the digital econ omy. In 2022-23, the digital economy accounted for 14.67 million workers, or 2.55% of Indias estimated work force. In comparison, agriculture accounted for 263.6 million (or 45.8% of total workforce), while manufacturing employed 65.6 milli on workers (or 11.4% of workforce). Our estima tion of the workforce is based on the same definitio n and scope as that for the digital economy GVA, implying tha t the digital economy is five times more productive , whe re productivity is measured by output-worker ratio, than the rest of the economy. This report is an attempt to compi le the first set of credible, comprehensibl e, and current estimates of Indias digital economy, based on the OECD framework, that is likely to be recommended to the System of National Accounts (SNA) update for 2025. There is significant scope to improve the estimates reported here through the better utilisation of existing data as well as closing data gaps. The latter can be divided into two broad categories: data that exists but has not been compiled or matched; and data that does not exist. With the methodology and data presented in this rep or t , t he gover nment has a re a d y temp late to p ro duce periodic updates and expand the measurement of the digital economy. Our recommendations focus on three main areas: (i) narrowing data gaps, both by collating and harmonising available data and collecting new data on the digital activities of enterprises and individuals; (ii) using new data to build digital SUTs that can enable the visibility of digitalisation in macroeconomic statistics; and (iii) engaging with the OECD to improve the measurement framework and facilitate global alignment. The report provides specific recommendations to improve the quality and coverage of national statistics pertaining to the digital economy as well as suggestions to accelerate the digitalisation of Indias economy.  15 The scope and speed of digitalisation in India has been remarkable in recent years. India has the worlds second largest mobile and internet network by number of users. Few countries see data traffic per smartphone as high as in India. The country has rolled out 5G faster than in other countries. It is also the global leader in terms of the volume of digital transactions and export of ICT services. India has become the largest contributor to global GitHub AI project, and ranks third in the number of homegrown unicorns (see Box 1). During its G20 Presidency, India was recognised as the champion of digital public infrastructures (DPIs) and is also seen as a well-established digital powerhouse.

While the depth and breadth of Indias digitalisation can be measured through various indicators of connectivity, adoption of digital services, and investment in new technologies, these factors cannot help ascertain its contributions to macro-aggregates, such as its share in the GDP and Box 1: Indias Digital Strides Mobile subscription: Of the latest estimated 8.36 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide, 1.78 billion are in China, followed by 1.14 billion in India and 372 million in the US.

Quantifying and understanding the role of the digital economy in driving economic growth, employment, and sustainable development is essential for both policymakers and the private sector to align resources and adopt strategies. Doing this requires a robust measurement system that enables continued estimation and monitoring. Previous studies by researchers and statistical and multilateral agencies have not yielded satisfactory results. The current system of national accounts does not lend itself directly to the measurement of the digital economy. A key challenge is defining its scope. The increasingly cross-cutting and integrated nature of digital technologies makes the concept of a distinct digital economy difficult to define. The second key challenge is the scarcity of appropriate and granular data, which poses a potential trade-off between accuracy and completeness in capturing the digital economy. The problem is not unique to India. Few countries have attempted to size up the digital economy, and even these efforts are works in progress. Appendix 1 provides a review of methodologies and their corresponding estimates across countries that have 6 Asian Development Bank. (2021).

This report uses globally adopted methodologiesi.e., frameworks developed by the OECD and ADBto provide estimates of Indias digital economy, both as a share of GVA/GDP and employment. 6 Our study builds on previous work done by RBI and MoSPI. The most recent estimate of Indias digital economy (Gajbhiye et al., 2022), which showed 8.5% of GVA in 2019, was based on the ADB framework using the input-output tables prepared by ADB. Anjoy et al. (2022) estimated the size of the digital economy in 2017-18 to be 7.38% of GVA through measuring employment in digital occupations and labour-input across 65 sectors using national accounts data and the PLFS 2017-18. Singh et al. (2022) presented an estimate of 7% of GVA in 2020-21 for ICT goods and services. They also broadened the scope of measurement by using machine-learning techniques to classify digital and brick-and-mortar companies. With the publication of this report, India will become among a handful of countries, and the first developing country, to provide a comprehensive and up to-date measurements of the digital economy, including new digital businesses and platforms.  17New approaches for measuring a new economy There are two popular approaches to measure the digital economy, one proposed by the ADB and the other by the OECD, respectively. The one laid out by the ADB uses the input-output analysis to estimate the value-added contribution of the digital industry and the share of the non-digital industries that enables production in the digital industry. 7 This approach equates the digital industry with the ICT industries, presenting a narrow scope of digitalisation. Specifically, the ADB approach does not fully or explicitly account for the activities of digital platforms and intermediaries or benefits to the downstream activities supported by them, such as the income and employment created by MSMEs selling on these platforms. The OECD approach, which is increasingly accepted globally, expands the scope of the digital economy to non-ICT industries. 8 The OECD framework focuses on two aspects of transactions in non-ICT industries: whether goods and services are digitally ordered or digitally delivered. It also defines new digital industries to include digital platforms and digital intermediaries, e-tailers, and financial service providers that operate digitally. 9 While the OECD approach is more accurate and intuitive, it also requires high-quality primary data; therefore, its implementation can be both expensive and time consuming. Most existing estimates for India are based on the ADB approach. This is the first study to estimate the Approach to Measurement 7 OECDs digital SUT framework is recommended to be included in the 2025 update of the System of National Accounts (SNA), the internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity 8 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

For appropriate international and domestic comparison, this study provides three estimates: (i) based on the ADB approach; (ii) based on the OECD approach; and (iii) the OECD augmented approach. As the ADB approach is narrower in scope and the global consensus gravitates towards the OECD approach, the main text of the report will focus on the OECD methodology and estimates, with the ADB approach and estimations presented in Appendix 2. Given the data limitations associated with developing digital Supply Use Tables (SUT) for India, this study estimates one of the high-priority indicators recommended by OECD, i.e., digital industries GVA and its components. 10 Our augmented approach goes beyond the OECD to estimate the digital share of three non-digital industries that have been significantly disrupted by digitalisation: trade, BFSI, and education. OECD approach The OECDs approach is based on the ways in which digital technologies are used to create value for industries, i.e., while producing, ordering, and delivering goods and services. Accordingly, it defines seven digital industries: (i) digitally enabling industries (DEIs); (ii) digital intermediary platforms charging a fee; (iii) data and advertising driven digital platforms; (iv) firms dependent on intermediary platforms; (v) e-tailers; (vi) digital-only firms providing financial and insuranceservices; and (vii) other producers only operatingdigitally. These categories are summarised in Figure 1. 18  Digitally Enabling Industry (DEI)Digital Intermediary Platforms (primarily fee-based)Digital Intermediary Platforms (primarily ad revenue -based)Firms dependent on intermediary platformsDigital only firms providing financial and insurance servicesOther producers operating only digitallyE-tailers OECD 3 OECD 6 OECD 2 OECD 5 OECD 4 OECD 7 OECD 1Figure 1: Digital Industries as Classified in the OECD Framework While the OECD 1 classification, i.e., DEI, is straightforward and its output is directly computable from the national accounts, the scope of other digital industries (i.e., OECD 2-7, excluding 4) has to be defined at the firm level. As shown in Table 1, we used four characteristics of digital transactions to classify firms into OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. These characteristics are: (i) revenue modelsubscription or advertisementbased; (ii) intermediation or ownership of goods andservices being provided; (iii) products/services beingdigitally or physically ordered; and (iv) products/services being digitally or physically delivered. Firms in all industries take digital orders, but goods and services may not be digitally delivered. These characteristics help distinguish between the OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 classifications. OECD 4 is self-explanatory, as it includes the income of individuals and businessesincluding small manufacturers, home-based entrepreneurs, gig workers, delivery partners, contracted drivers, content creators, and influencerswho depend on these digital platforms. For detailed OECD definitions of the seven industries, see Appendix 3.

There are several examples of e-sellers in India, including Country Delight, Treebo, and House of Ganges.  19The OECD approach uses these seven industry categories to create digital SUTs for an estimation of the digital economy. Conventional SUTs provided by national statistics agencies, are disaggregated to reallocate domestic output and intermediate use of industries to the new digital industries defined by OECD. This disaggregation and rebalancing exercise requires detailed information on digital transaction type and volume for each industry, which are usually collected through government enterprise surveys. The OECD itself admits that this might be an ambitious ask from countries. Accordingly, the Informal Advisory Group on Measuring GDP in a Digitalised economy proposed a set of high-priority indicators that can help coordinate initial results across countries. Countries like Canada, US, Sweden, Japan, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Netherlands have attempted to measure their digital economy using the OECD framework, but their coverage has varied widely. USs BEA defines some digital activities from the OECD guidelines, namely, infrastructure, e-commerce, and priced digital services, which are mapped back to their industries. 11,12 Canada and Australia both follow approaches similar to that of US.13,14 Canada published its initial set of SUTs in 2020, which are currently being revised and updated. 15 Netherlands and Sweden produced their updated digital SUTs in 2021.16 The OECD recommends publishing high-priority indicators and digital SUTs, even if they are experimental. 17 In the absence of detailed information on transaction type and digital volume at the sector level in India, creating a digital SUT is not feasible. There is not adequate granular data to split conventional industry groupings and reclassify them for digital products and digital industries. We therefore estimate the GVA 11 Nicholson, J.

Our estimates are based on a triangulation of data from multiple sources, including data published by the NAD of MoSPI, the MCA database, CMIE Prowess, Tracxn, Employees Provident Fund Organisations Establishment Search portal, PLFS, ASI, and various market studies, industry reports, and company annual reports. Non-digital industries are outside the scope of the OECD approach. Given the digital disruptions in several traditional industries, we recommend the OECD augmented model to capture the digitalisation of firms within traditional industries that are also selling digitally but are not included in the OECD 1 -7 classification. We used primary surveys and focus group discussions to estimate the trends for three sectorstrade, BFSI, and educa tionand add their estimated digital output to the overall estimate, excluding any duplication. Scope of Measurement There is no single source of data for estima ting all seven OECD digital industries. The different data sources and assumptions used to estimate the GVA of OECD 1 -7 are discussed below. OECD 1: Digitally Enabling Industry (DEI). This industry is similar in scope to the ADBs definition of the core digital economy, which includes computer-related services, telecommunication services, manufacture of ICT goods (computers, communication equipment, etc.), and trade and repair of ICT goods. Given the increasingly digital nature of services involved in motion pictures, video and television programme production, 20  and broadcasting activities, these factors have also been added to the scope of the digitally enabling industry (see Table 2). These sub-sectors have also been included in the BEAs estimate for the size of the USs digital economy (see Appendix 4 for a comparison of the scope of the digitally enabling industry as defi ned by different countries). The estimation of the digitally enabling industry is entirely based on estimates from the NAS, provided by MoSPI in their 2024 report. The data pertains to the year 2022-23. Table 2: Unpacking the digital ly enabling industry (DEI) into identifiable industries and sub-industries with relevant NIC codes OECD 1: Digitally Enabling Industry (DEI)Industry Category NIC Code Manufacture of electronic component, consumer electronics, magnetic and optical media261,264,268 Manufacture of computer and peripheral equipment 262 Manufacture of communication equipment 263 Telecommunication 61 - 61103 Information and computer related services 62, 63 Wholesale trade and repair of computers 9511, 9512, 4651, 4652 Cable operators, broadcasters, recording and publishing 61103, 59, 60 OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7: Digital Intermediaries and Platforms. Firms within OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 cut across different industries according to the existing national accounts classification. For example, Amazon and Spinny while classified by NAS under wholesale and retail trade, by OECD definitions, they are classified as digital intermediary platforms charging a fee (OECD 2). Other digital intermediary platforms have been included under information and communication, administrative and support service categories, etc., implying that a sectoral approach of estimation or directly attributing values from NAS, for these digital industries will not work. We therefore compiled a database of domestic and non-domestic digital platforms using Tracxns company database. We filtered companies that were either categorised as consumer digital and selected those with a revenue of USD 50 million and above in 2022-23. The threshold, observably, included most companies that Source: ICRIER had any meaningful market share. However, for some upcoming companies, or those that were smaller in size, but considerably popular were also added, irrespective of their revenue. The final usable list of companies included 253 digital intermediaries and platforms. See Appendix 5 for the list of intermediaries used in our estimation and classification into OECD digital industries. It is important to note that some of the firms in this list were already a part of the corporate GVA for the digitally enabling industry (DEI or OECD 1). To avoid any double counting, we have removed the GVA of these select companies from the total of the DEI. Finally, the revenue figures for these companies have been converted to GVA values for aggregation- the ratios used are as per those in the NAS. For companies where revenue of 2022-23 has not been filed with the MCA, we extrapolate values using past year growth rates. See Figure 2 for steps followed for estimating the value of OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7.  21OECD 4: Firms and Individuals Dependent on Digital Intermediary Platforms. This category includes incomes and profits of a variety of stakeholders, such as MSME manufacturers and service providers, home-based entrepreneurs, gig workers such as delivery partners, content creators, and online influencers. As expected, there is no single source of credible data from which this category can be measured. Therefore, we used a combination of approaches. For the income of firms and individuals selling on intermediary platforms, we used estimates of GMV, subtracted the margin charged by platforms, and assumed a share of profit from the residual. 18 The share of profit for MSMEs was determined through survey-based research studies.19 For the income of gig workers on shared mobility Compiled a database of domestic and non-domestic digital platforms with defined thresholds (Source: Tracxn)Identified and verified the relevant NIC code of these firms (Source: MCA, MoSPI) Reclassified firms into the OECD digital industries (Source: ICRIER)Removed duplication if firm already existed in the sectors included in DEI, and adjusted for GVA (Source: ICRIER) Source: ICRIER MethodologyFigure 2: Steps in Estimation for OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 Industries platforms, we only subtracted the commission paid by driver partners to the platform. The net income, after subtracting for costs such as vehicle maintenance and fuel, could not be estimated. Therefore, this is an upper limit for gig workers income. For content creators and influencers, we used a lower bound estimate, including only the reported income of YouTubers. 20 All assumptions and sources of data are provided in Appendix 6. OECD Augmented. Finally, we extended the OECD estimation to include the digital share of a few traditional industries: retail and wholesale trade, banking, BFSI, and education, which are industries that have experienced high levels of digitalisation and 18 Annual Survey of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India, ICRIER 2023 https://icrier.org/publications/annual-survey-of-micro-small-and-medium- enterprises-msmes-in-india-leveraging-e-commerce-for-the-growth-of-msmes/ 19 https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/youtube-india-ishan-john-chatterjee-fanfest-creator-economy-content-creators-17904491.htm 20 Ranipeta, S.

This was indeed a first-of-its-kind survey for the industry, which has not compiled any data, statutory or internal, to estimate the share of the digital economy. The survey was conducted in partnership with the CII and supported by MeitY, especially for data from the banking sector. The sample was restricted to the corporate sector and comprised the top 10-30 companies in each industry, especially those in which digitalisation was most likely. The data sought was for the year 2023-24 and focused mainly on revenue that was digitally generated and employment that was driving the digital aspects of the business. Questionnaires had to be customised for some sectors to reflect the differences in business models, types of transactions, and sources of revenue. Copies of the questionnaires and the estimated digital share for each sector are provided in Appendix 7. Data was collected Augmented OECD approach Figure 3: Measurement frameworks for Indias digital economy using global approaches Source: ICRIER Note: The original OECD framework does not require separate estimates for box IV and V, as their estimates are captured through the digital SUTs.

Rest of the traditional sectors selling online from March to May 2024. The survey estimates were used to extrapolate only for the corporate share of GVA for the sector. The scope of estimation for this study is summarised in Figure 3. The ADB estimates are provided separately and largely overlap with the OECDs digitally enabling industry. Aggregating the rest of the OECD industries provides an estimate of the overall digital economy. The OECD augmented approach captures the digital share for a few traditional sectors over and above the OECD digital industries but is currently limited to three sectors of the economy. Figure 3 indicates why determining a point estimate of the size of the digital economy is neither easy nor desirable. The scope between digital and non- digital is shifting every day, and depending on where one decides to draw the line, the point estimate could vary considerably. Thus, even the OECD augmented estimates presented here can be criticised for not capturing the entire digital economy as it excludes the digital output of several traditional sectors such as health, logistics and transport, and public administration (see Box V in Figure 3). 21 Calvino, F., Criscuolo, C., Marcolin, L.,  Squicciarini, M.

The share of OECD 1 or the digitally enabling industry (DEI), which is also defined as the core of the digital economy, in national GVA is found to be 7.83 per cent. The new digital industries, which include big techs, other digital platforms and intermediaries as well as firms dependent on digital intermediaries (OECD 2-7), account for nearly 2 per cent of GVA. As expected, firms dependent on digital intermediaries (OECD 4) have a higher output Output and Employment Estimates 22 GVA 2022- 23 is INR 246.59 lakh crore and GDP 2022-23 is INR 269.5 lakh crore https://iced.niti.gov.in/economy-and-demography/key-economic-indicators/gva USD estimate using 2022 average exchange rate of 78.598 from https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/yearly-average-currency-exchange-rates7.83% 0.41%0.05%0.69%0.10%0.18%0.31%0.20%9.76%0.48%1.21% 0.28% 11.74%Digitally Enabling Industry (adjusted) Digital intermediaries charging a fee Data and adverti sing driven digital intermediaries Firms dependent on digital intermediaries E tailers Digital only ﬁrms providing ﬁn.  insurance services Other producers operating digitally E - seller Digital Economy (OECD comparable) Trade (oﬄine ﬁrms selling online) BFSI (oﬄine ﬁrms selling online) Education (oﬄine ﬁrms selling online) Digital Economy (OECD augmented)Figure 4: GVA of Indias Digital Economy, 2022-23than the intermediaries themselves (OECD 2 and 3), reflecting the multiplier effect of the latter. Also, the combined contribution of the three traditional industries (BFSI, trade and education) to national output is around 2 per cent, rivaling in importance to the new digital industries. This is a clear indication of the digital economy moving outside the realm of big tech and digital platforms to digitalization in the rest of economy. Going forward the increasing share of the digital economy in GVA is likely to come from traditional industries adopting digital tools and practices. Among all sectors, the BFSI sector seems to be the most digitized, with nearly 20 per cent of the sectoral output coming from the digital side (see Sector Highlights for more details).

In the augmented segment, while banking and financial sector contribute 10.3 per cent of the digital economys GVA, retail trade and education contribute 4.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively (see Appendix 8 for estimation for the Augmented sectors).The corollary is to see the share of these components in the overall digital industry. The digitally enabling industry, which also includes some of the high growth sectors of the economy such as cloud computing services and some global capability centres, is the largest contributor to the GVA of the digital economy (see Box 2). It accounts for 67 per cent of the digital economy GVA (see Table 3). As per our estimates the other highest contributors to the OECD definition of SectorsGVA (Rs.

Table 3: GVA Estimates for the Digital Economy, 2022-23  25 The digital economys share in national income has seen a consistent rise over time. We present the trajectory using a combination of estimates provided by previous studies, our estimates from the ADB approach (which use a more disaggregated input-output table (66 X 66 industries) than those used by ADB), and the OECD approach. 23 The size of the digital economy was estimated to be 11.74% in 2022-23 (see Figure 5). Although the comparison is between two different approaches of measurement that define the scope differently, a comparison of ADB estimates over time would also indicate an increase. Since the OECD 23 Refer to Appendix 2 for details on the ADB approachapproach delves into the changing nature of digital business models and their contribution to the GVA, in addition to the role of the digitally enabling industry, the approach would be better suited for estimating the digital economy. There is, however, scope to improve and adapt the OECD approach to capture important digital industries. A flexible approach will allow the OECD approach to capture the changing nature of digital businesses as well as capture the digitalised components of traditional businesses. We have used the OECD augmented approach to reflect the latter f actor. Box 2: Some of the Faster Growing Segments of the Digital Economy Cloud Market: Indias cloud market (public) accounted for 1. 1-1.2% of the global market in 2020-23 and is estimated to have grown at a CAGR of 29% to reach USD 8.3 billion. With businesses increasingly adopting AI for streamlining operations, enhancing productivity, improving customer experience, and launching new services, the cloud market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24% over the 2024-27 period to reach USD 20.3 billion by the end of 202 7. In the NAS, cloud services are recoded under computer-related services (OECD 1). Computer-related services also happens to be the fastest growing sub-sector for the digitally enabling industry. Between 2011-12 and 2022-23, the CAGR of this sector is 16.2%, compared to 15.6% for the manufacture of communication equipment and 10% for both the manufacture of computer and peripheral equipment and telecommunication services. GCCs: GCCs are offshore centres established by multinational corpora tions to provide a variety of services to their parent organisations, including RD, IT support, and business process management. India has also become an international leader for GCCs, home to almost 55% of the worlds GCCs in 2022. The number of operational GCCs in India has been on the rise, from 1250 in 2017 -19, to 1580 in 2020-22, and predicted to rise to 1900 in 2023-25. Among 22 of the top GCCs in India, nine are classified within the ICT sector, specifically computer-related services. In 2022-23, the revenue of these companies stood at around 3.1% of the total output of DEI and 6% of total output of computer-related services. Indias growth in computer-related activities has been consistently strong, with more opportunities on the horizon in this sub-sector.

The former refers to overall sale, while the latter is gross value added. 26  Digitalisation of traditional sectors The primary survey and stakeholder discussions highlighted interesting facts about how different sectors are digitalising and their contribution to the revenue generated by firms. Not all aspects of businesses are digitalising uniformly. For example, retail sales are digitalising much more than wholesale sales. Firms are also investing in digital methods for customer acquisition and business development. Chatbots and AI applications are fairly commonplace. Sector-specific highlights are summarised below. BFSI. In the BFSI sector, the highest level of digitalisation has occurred in the payments segment of banks. On average, over 95% of payment transactions for public and private sector banks are now digital. Other transaction categories, such as loan applications and investments, are relatively less digitalised. While the digital share of transactions for banks is observed to be very high, the digital share of revenue is low, as some of the highest revenue-generating activities are Figure 5: Estimates for Size of Indias Digital Economy 2014-15 to 2022-23 Source: Compiled by ICRIER largely offline. Other financial services institutions are relatively less digitalised than banks. Retail. For the retail sector, most companies are opting for an omni-channel model, of which digital is a steadily growing part. In fact, many companies are developing their own platforms in addition to selling on intermediary platforms. An interesting trend is that e-tailers and e-sellers such as Nykaa, Urban Ladder, FirstCry that began as completely online models have, over time, invested in physical stores. While the share of online selling is growing, offline formats will continue to exist and grow for some companies. Additionally, while the use of AI chatbots is becoming very common among retail companies at the customer end, internal processes are being optimised through the use of digital inventory-management tools. Education. Among educational institutions, there are three clear formats exist: complete offline, hybrid, and complete online. Most large institutions use a Note: RBI (2022) refers to the following study conducted by RBI researchers: Gajbhiye, D., Arora, R., Nahar, A., Yangdol, R.,  Thakur, I. (2022, December).

As is the case with retail, some edutech firms such as Physics Wallah have transitioned from a completely online to a hybrid model. Hospitality and logistics. Hotels are digitalising several aspects of their business, including supply chain, vendor management, customer experience, and sales. On the sales side, by investing in new technologies like metaverse and AI, hotels are creating virtual experiences for potential customers, which are near-perfect substitutes for physical visits. Most interviews suggest that digital sales for their sector are likely to increase by 10-25% in the next five years. Most large logistics companies have completely digitalised the tracking of shipped goods. Pick-ups and delivery are also coordinated digitally. However, smaller courier and shipping companies and those operating in the informal sector are only partially digitalised. Projections: The future is bright Digital economy will account for nearly one-fifth of the economy by 2030 Indias digital economy is expected to grow almost twice as fast as the overall economy, accounting for nearly 20% of the GVA by 2030. This includes the digital economy defined by OECD as well as the digital share of three sectors identified as digitally disrupted. If we only consider the OECD definition, then the digital econ omy is estimated to be 16.5% of the total economy in 2030 (see Figure 6a). The projections are based on four assumptions: (i) the decadal rate of growth of the DEI enabling industry, data for which is available in the national accounts; (ii) the rate of growth of revenue for digital businesses and platforms for the last two y ears; (iii) the rate of growth of the traditional industries inc luded in the augmented analysis; and (iv) the expe cted rate of digitalisation for these traditional industries. As ex pected, the digital economy has been growing much faster than the rest of the economy. While the overall economy, measured in nominal GVA, was growing at a rate of 11.8% over the last 10 years, the sectors comprising the digital-enabling industry were growing at 1 7.3%. Digital platforms and intermediaries are growing much faster (30%) and are likely to do so for the next few years. Consequently, the gains to businesses and individual entrepreneurs are also going to be higher. The diverging trends between the DEI enabling industry and the OECD estimate of the entire digital economy, and between the OECD and OECD augmented estimates, suggest that the share of Indias digital economy is expected to increase not only from the growth of the DEI enabling industries but its wider diffusion in the rest of the economy. For all assumptions and calculations, see Appendix 9.

Note: Size of GDP attributable to the digital economy in Figure 6b are projected by applying the estimated percentages of GVA attributable to the digital economy shown in Figure 6a to estimates of projected GDP from IMF. Based on these assumptions, the digital economy is expected to surpass USD 1 trillion by 2029. Contribution to Employment Digital economy employs nearly 2.5% of the workforce In 2022-23, the digital economy accounted for 14.67 million workers, or 2.55% of Indias workforce. The estimation is b ased on the same definition and scope as that for the digital economy GVA. The data has also been triangulated from different sources, as was the case for GVA. See Figure 7 for a disaggregation of the employment estimates, which shows that the highest share of employment is in the DEI enabling industry (58.07%), corresponding to the digital GVA shares. Men constitute about 78% of the employment in the DEI enabling industry; however, the services sub- sectors show a slightly lower gender gap (75% male). The gender split for the rest of the components is not available. While core activities involving the production of digital technologies or services may still be dominated b y men, such as in coding and programming activities and STEM-related occupations, the digitalisation process itself has been associated with increased female employment.25 Not only do digital platforms create new job opportunities for women, the digitalisation of  29traditional sectors also create options for women that were hitherto unavailable due to mobility restrictions and safety concerns. Finally, as suggested above, while the platform economy has the potential to be gender inclusive in its employment creation (such as professional 25 C anavire-Bacarreza, Y. Y. G.

Box 3: Comparison of other estimates of employment in the digital economy NASSCOM estimates direct employment of 5.43 million people in 2024 in the following sectors: IT services, business process management, engineering research  development, software products, and hardware.28 On the other hand, our estimate for DEI is 8.52 million. However, the NASSCOM estimate is not directly comparable with ours because the scope of DEI is broader and the NIC industries included in the two estimates are also different. NITI Aayogs Gig Economy report estimated that, in 2020-21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig economy (2.6% of the non-agricultural workforce or 1.5% of the total workforce). They used data from the NSS Employment Unemployment Survey and the PLFS to estimate the number of individuals employed in the gig economy (non-agricultural sectors) by using broader filters. The first level of filtering uses data for individuals between 18 and 45 years in the top 100 cities, with education from secondary school to graduation, and household consumption expenditure below the 75th percentile of monthly per-capita consumption expenditure. This estimate was then narrowed down to occupations that can be part of the gig economy and industries with large concentrations of gig work. Finally, the share of workers with a mobile phone and bank account were applied based on World Bank estimates to arrive at an estimate of employment in the platform gig economy. Other estimates for gig work include Fairworks 2020 report that estimated that about 30.3 lakh (3.03 million) individuals were employed by eleven large platforms as gig workers. Our estimates of gig workers and content creators, which is part of OECD 4 industry, is 45.2 lakhs in 2022- 23which is between the NITI Aayog and Fairwork estimates. Our estimates are likely to be lower than the actual numbers because they include gig workers in only 75% of total platform and intermediaries, which were the only ones for which reliable data was available. 30  The structure of employment for the digital economy appears to be bimodal, with over 37% comprising platform gig workers, content creators, and digital sales in MSMEs (OECD 4) and the rest accounting for a mix of manufacturing workers, managers, engineers, For the OECD augmented section, employment estimates are considerably lower than their GVA estimates, constituting only 1.06% of the overall estimate of employment in the digital economy, compared to 16.8% in the share of digital GVA. This estimation is based on the primary survey. In general, 29 Estimates of percentage of employment that is attributable to the digital economy for the three sectors is calculated as average over the firms surveyed, weighted by their revenue. The survey defined digital employment as those engaged in the following digital activities: IT management, software management, computer management, web publishing, digital media marketing, data analytics, telecommunications, and telemarketing. These sector-wise estimates of percentage attributable to digital were then applied to estimates of the number of individuals employed in the private sector (public/private limited companies), which were calculated based on percentages from the PLFS applied to an estimated total employment of 575,540,000 based on MoHFW projections.Source: ICRIER estimates58.07%0.71%0.14%37.76%0.89%0.69%0.36%0.33%98.94%0.54%0.50%0.02% 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14Digital ly Enabling IndustryDigital intermediary platforms charging a feeData and advertising driven digital platformsFirms dependent on digital intermediariesE tailersDigital only ﬁrms providing ﬁnancial  insurance servicesOther producers operating digitallyE - sellerDigital Economy (OECD Comparable)TradeFinancial ServicesEducationDigital Economy (OECD Augmented) Number employed (millions)Breakdown of Employment in the Digital Economy % of employment in the digital economy14.51 million14.67 million 5.54 million 8.52 millionFigure 7: Breakdown of Employment in the Digital Economyand other professionals. In its current form, the former group tends to be more precarious and lower paid, while the latter group tends to be characterised by salaried jobs with higher pay levels and better working conditions. besides the IT department, firms have limited jobs that are dedicatedly digital. Resources that serve digital sales or digital content usually perform other roles as well. See Appendix 10 for detailed calculations of the employment estimate. 29  31 30 Total GVA for trade and repair services was INR 2615146 crore in 2022-23. The corresponding employment number for retail and wholesale trade estimated from PLFS is 58.7 million (10.2% of total UPSS employment). 31 These are rough estimates for labour productivity, as the composition of labour unit across sectors is not uniformly defined. The employment numbers include both full-time and part-time workers are also based on assumptions. 32 Estimates for GVA of 4651 and 4652, and 9511 and 9512 will be partitioned from aggregate values as available in the NAS.Accordingly, the labour productivity calculated for the digital share of these traditional sectors is higher than for the rest of the sector. For example, in the retail and trade sector, the estimated labour productivity based on reported statistics from NAS and PLFS is approximately INR 4.5 lakhs per unit of labour for the overall sector, while that for the digital share is INR 1.5 crore. 30 In general, we find that labour productivity Box 4: Our Estimates are Likely to be Conservative and Downward Biased While our estimates go beyond the OECD framework to include digitalisation in traditional sectors, not all components of the OECD framework have been adequately represented in our estimation. This is largely due to challenges of data availability and usability. Sectors under the digitally enabling industry (OECD 1) are well aligned to the national industry classification and therefore adequately captured. However, minor discrepancies may exist when differentiating between the GVA of industries that are often grouped together, such as ICT trade, repair of communication equipment, and computers  peripheral equipment, for which disaggregated values are not available. There is no comprehensive list available for digital platforms covered under OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.For this data, we relied on our own compiled list of companies categorised as consumer digital companies, most of which have a revenue of USD 50 million (INR 400 crores equivalent) and above, thereby excluding several small and medium- sized start-ups. Even for this list, data for all companies wa s not available. The employment estimates are also based on this list. Estimates for GVA as well as em ployment for OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are therefore underestimated.for the digital economy is five times greater than the rest of the economy, highest for digital intermediaries and platforms, followed by the digitally enabling industry, and lowest for firms benefitting from digital intermediaries. The labour productivity of firms dependent on intermediaries is similar to that of the overall economy.31 32  This report is an attempt to put together the first set of credible, comprehensible and current estimates on Indias digital economy. The limitations of this report are largely a result of the data gaps that make assessment of a dynamic phenomenon like the digital economy very challenging. The data gaps can be divided into two main categories: (i) data that exists but has not been compiled or matched and (ii) data that does not exist. In the first category, the following require attention: The way NIC codes are assigned to companies is not uniform across different agencies (e.g., MCA and MoSPI). This makes the matching and compilationof data from different sources challenging.  The assignment of companies to industries in the NAS is not public information. In the absenceof knowledge of how companies are assignedparticularly those that are largely digital or areregistered as IT companies but create value inother sectors like retail, education, transportation,or finance (i.e., their parent industry)can resultin the aggregation of GVA at the sectoral levelbeing inaccurate. A uniform principle for theirclassification going forward would be important.  A un iversal database of digital intermediaries and platforms is not available. Data when compiled fromdifferent market research databases, MCA, EPFO,or a web search, cannot be verified. Importantcompanies may also be left out in the filteringprocess.  Lac k of public data on disaggregates affects the accuracy of the estimation. Availability of sectordisaggregates helps distinguish between the digitaland non-digital components of a sector, which areotherwise grouped together in national accounts.For example, publishing includes web and softwarepublishing as well as the publishing of books andprinted material.Data Gaps in the Measurement of the Digital Economy In the second category, the gaps are as follows: Lac k of updated input-output table IOTs and SUTs that capture digitalisation-led structural changes in the economy Lac k of enterprise surveys (both for manufacturing and services) that can estimate the numberand share of firms receiving orders digitally anddelivering digitally. These surveys will help builddigital SUTs from national SUTs.  Lac k of data on gig workers, including home-based entrepreneurs, delivery partners, contractualdrivers, influencers, content creators, andfreelancers Recommendations for measuring the size of Indias digital economy The recommendations are developed from the data gaps and limitations identified in this report. While recommendations have been categorised into four distinct categories, they are interdependent and flow into each other.  Nar row the data gap Exp and the enterprise surveysfor both manufacturing and servicesto include questions on digitalisation and the use ofdigital technologies, including questions ondigital exports and imports.

It is equally important torecognise the efforts of digitalisation intraditional industries, which may currentlybe small but are will expand significantly overtime. In this report, this approach has beenpresented as OECD augmented for the trade,BFSI and, education sectors.  Mo ve beyond the estimation of size to measure impact Me itY should consider undertaking a separate study on estimating the productivity gains from digitalisation that help ascertain supply-side efficiencies, especially for manufacturingsectors that do not necessarily order anddeliver digitally. The analysis will complementestimates presented in this report that definedigital industries based on a narrow set ofcharacteristics for firms.  Th e Ministry of Labour  Employment should consider undertaking a study to understandthe impacts on employment and labourmarkets, especially from the gender lens. It isimportant to study the impact of digitalisationon different occupations and the net effect onemployment in different sectors. 34  Following from our analysis and measurement of Indias digital economy, there can be three levers that contribute to the size of Indias digital economy: (i) the DEI enabling industry, which broadly comprises IT services, manufacture of electronic components, and com puters; (ii) digital platforms and intermediaries; an d (iii) traditional non-digital sectors of the economy, which are also digitalising rapidly. Digitalisation of the Recommendations for Accelerating the Pace of Digitalisation in India 33 MeitY. (2022). Promotion of digital literacy. https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID1885958 34 NSSO. (2023). Multiple indicator survey in India  202-2021. NSS Report No. 589. https://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Multipl eIndicatorSurveyinIndiaf.pdfeconomy can be accelerated through each of these levers. When it comes to policies, we group them into five categories, as shown in Table 4. Each policy pillar can apply to one or more than one lever. For instance, digital literacy and skilling is applicable to all levers while ensuring regulatory certainty seems most pressing for digital platforms and intermediaries. Table 4: Policy recommendations to accelerate the pace of digitalisation in India LeverPolicyßDigital Literacy and SkillingRegulatory CertaintyCyber Security  TrustEase of Doing BusinessDigital Infrastructure Digitally Enabling Industry   Digital Platforms and Intermediaries     Traditionally non-digital sectors    Adopt collaborative and concerted efforts for digital literacy and skilling Digital literacy has been at the centre of government policies to promote digitalisation. The Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan (DISHA) or National Digital Literacy Mission was formulated in 2017 to provide IT training to 52.5 lakh people. Subsequently, the government introduced the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan (PMGDISHA) with a target train six crore individuals, including Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers. 3 3 Although both programmes have concluded, survey results reflect that the country lags behind in digital literacy. According to the NSSOs Multiple Indicator Survey published in 2023, 70% of Indian youth aged between 15 and 29 years cannot send emails with files attached, and nearly 60% cannot copy and move a file or folder. 34 In the absence of these basic digital skills, citizens will find it challenging to benefit from the digitalisation of government services. Moreover, employability is a huge challenge. The gains of digitalisation will reflect when citizens and businesses are able to use available digital tools at scale. Accordingly, we recommend the following:  Encour age improvement in outcomes of basic education and literacy in primary and secondary schools as a prerequisite for strengthening digitalliteracy, and incorporate digital literacy in the K-12programme in schools  Make co ncerted efforts towards reducing adult illiteracy and skilling that necessitates improvedcoordination between different government  35departments, greater involvement of the private sector, and increased use of technology-aided programmes  Imp lement well-designed and curated programmes that help improve employability Inc orporate the use of edge technologies like AI and robotics Minimise regulatory uncertainty for digital platforms and intermediaries The rapid scaling of digital platforms and new digital businesses have also raised alarm bells on the risks of misselling, the misuse of personal data, misinformation, and monopolisation, among others. Regulators and policymakers have responded with a series of new regulations addressing the risks from new digital businesses. Many regulations are either under consultation, in draft stage, or have rules pending. Most regulations see at least a few shifts. Until finalised, businesses, especially new businesses, would find it challenging to navigate uncertainty. We recommend the following:  Con duct transparent and timely consultations Coo rdinate with all involved government bodies to ensure regulatory alignment Min imise time between the announcement of intent and passing of law Bri ng regulatory clarity on the use of emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies, gaming, and generative AI, and removing frictions in theoperation of digital platforms Enhance cybersecurity and trust Cyberattacks and cybercrimes are the weakest link of in rapidly digitalising economiesin India as well as most countries in the world. Some sectors, such as health, banking, and government institutions, are more susceptible to attacks than others. Accelerating digitalisation requires building resilience and trust. We recommend the following: Inc entivise businesses to invest in cybersecurity systems Inc rease cybersecurity awareness, making it a key component of digital skilling programmes Bui ld cross-country collaboration for the identification and mitigation of cybercrimes Str engthen cybersecurity response teams Invest in RD to build stronger and more secure ITnetworks Improve the ease of doing business Government policies and fiscal incen tives, such as for IT services, mobile phones, and telecommunications, h ave helped the Indian industry grow. However, the push is not adequate to create the acceleration that the digitally enabling industry requires to produce resilient, indigenous products both for domestic needs and for exports. The off-take on semiconductors is slow, value addition in mobile phones is low, telecom is yet to unleash competitive forces, and representation in standard-setting is limited. In light of this, we recommend the following: Enhance coordination among key government departments, such as the Department ofCommerce, MeitY, and Department of Telecom, toprovide comprehensive policies and targeted fiscalschemes that help reduce cost disabilities  Invest in high-quality physical infrastructure, suchas logistics and energy resources, that lower thecost of doing business  Improve Centre-State coordination, and providefriendly terms to investors, both foreign anddomestic  Review and re-evaluate business laws, includinglabour laws (e.g., extending work hours in ICTsector, providing adequate safeguards for workers,etc.) to create a balance between labour rights andcompliance cost 36  Make high-quality broadband universal Indias digital ambition relies on access to high-quality and universal broadband. The coverage and quality of infrastructure has increased by leaps and bounds, but the journey is far from complete. The increase is data consumption has proven that existing bandwidth levels are grossly inadequate, leading to challenges such as call drops. Additionally, besides urban blind spots, several rural government schools and hospitals are not connected to the internet. Access to broadband infrastructure will not only help expand the footprint of digital businesses but also enable traditional businesses to offer their services digitally. We recommend the following: M ake continued efforts towards building resilient fixed-line broadband networks to supplementmobile coverage  I ncentivise the private sector to invest in quality upgrades through appropriate policy interventions Co mbine supply-side efforts with demand-side interventions to ensure the affordability of devicesand data services  37Table A1: Cross-Country Review of Methodologies (other than OECD approach) Author, Year of PublishingCountry Estimate Year Estimation approach Other details RBI, 2022India 8.5% of GVA 2019 Uses satellite accounts based on national SUTs and IOTs.

Estimates are not directly comparable due to the scope of coverageAuthor, Year of PublishingCountry Estimate Year Estimation approach Other details  41Our estimation based on the ADB approach relies on the SUT published by the Ministry of Statistics and Program Our estimation based on the ADB approach relies on the SUTs published by MoSPI as the starting point. This appendix provides details about how this was conducted. The SUTs depict the structure of an economy by showing linkages between how products are produced and used by an industry. The latest available SUT for India is for 2019-20. These SUTs are transformed into IOTs, an industry-to-industry matrix that provides inter-industry linkages. Industries in the IOT can be classified into fully digital, partially digital, or non-digital. For partially digital industries, only the relevant shares are included in the estimation. The existing estimate for Indias digital economy is based on ADBs annually published 35 industry by 35 industry (35 x 35) national IOT.36 According to their analysis, Indias digital economy was estimated at 8.5% of GVA in 2019-20. The IOT used for this analysis is based on the World Input Output Database (WIOD), which relies on MoSPIs 2014-15 SUT. While it has been updated by ADB to reflect aggregate changes in the economy for 2019-20, the underlying production structure of the economy continues to reflect that of 2014-15. In other words, massive digitalisation since the launch of the Digital India programme and further acceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not captured in their estimates. Digital shifts for industries such as financial services, including the scaling of digital payments, direct benefit transfer, retail through e-commerce, and education through e-learning services, which lead to higher productivity and output are therefore not fully reflected in these estimates. 36 Gajbhiye, D., Arora, R., Nahar, A., Yangdol, R.,  Thakur, I.

RBI Bulletin. https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/ Bulletin/PDFs/05ART201220221265B8E871824B98970F03E87228C0FE.PDF 37 We follow the model B transformation approach conducted under the industry technology assumption, which states that each industry has its own specific way of production, irrespective of its product mix. More details on the transformation are provided later.In addition to providing comparable and updated estimates using the ADBs 35 x 35 IOT for 2022, this study builds upon previous work in two ways:  Provides more updated data, reflecting a more updated structure of the economy by using the latest SUT of 2019-20, which was not available for previous studies  Provides more disaggregated data, transforming the SUTs into corresponding IOTs that are more disaggregated than the ones used in previous studies, allowing for more granular partitioning of industries into digital and non-digital, thus providing more accurate estimates. Our final estimates are based on this IOT. This study uses the latest 2019-20 SUT from MoSPI, and transforms it into a 66 industry x 66 industry IOT using ADBs methodology37. Unlike the 35 industry X 35 industry IOT, there are fewer partially digital sectors. This reduces the assumptions in the model and serves as a more accurate representation of the core digital economy. The core of the digital economy is defined as products or industries belonging to 5 groups: hardware, software publishing, web publishing, telecommunication services, and specialized  support services. Table A3 below provides the list of industries that fall within this definition as per the ISIC classification and matches them to the industry categories for the two IOTs.Appendix 2: Details of the ADB approach adopted to estimate Indias core digital economy 42  38 The 2019-20 IOT has discrepancies between output-side and expenditure-side aggregates, consistent with the discrepancies reported in NAS. These have been addressed to arrive at a balanced matrix. Discrepancies in the IOTs of subsequent year have also been addressed similarly.Table A3: Scope of Core Digital Industries Core digital industries ADBs 35 X 35 IOT Indias 66 X 66 IOT Main Activity Group Code Industry Industry Industry Hardware2620Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment Electrical and Optical Equipment (P)Manufacturing of computer and peripheral equipment 2680Manufacture of magnetic and optical mediaManufacturing of electronic component, consumer electronics, magnetic and optical media (P) Telecommunications services61Telecommunications servicesPost and Telecommunication (P)Communications (P) Specialized and support services62Computer programming services, consulting, and other related services Renting of Machinery and Equipment and Other Business Activities (P)Computer-related services 6311Data processing, hosting, and related activities Web publishing 6312 Web portals Software publishing 5820 Software publishing Source: ADB (2021); Authors calculations. Sectors marked with (P) are partitioned to include only digital components, while others are completely digital. Manufacturing of computer and peripheral equipment and Computer related services are treated as fully digital sectors in the 66 x 66 IOT. The partially digital sectors are identified as Communications and Manufacturing of electronic components, consumer electronics, magnetic and optical media. In line with ADBs definition, the digital component of the core digital industry, Telecommunications, is partitioned from the broader Communications industry by using its share in GVA from NAS. The digital component of Manufacturing of electronic components in Manufacturing of magnetic and optical media is partitioned using the 2019-20 ASI. After partitioning the IOT into clean digital and non-digital industries, we use the Leontief inverse to arrive at new estimates for the digital economy for 2019-20. To estimate the shares for 2020-21 and 2021-22, we extrapolate the 2019-20 IOT using corresponding financial year aggregates from NAS.38 The approach followed for future projections is discussed in Section 4 of this paper. Below is a comparison of the estimates, data, and assumptions.  43Table A4: Comparison of Estimation Based on ADB Approach ICRIER Estimate Based on Disaggregated IOTICRIER Estimate Based on Aggregated IOTGajbhiye et al.

The IOT is based on basic-price use table, while the reported use table is at the purchasers price. To arrive at the basic-price use table from a purchasers price use table, we adjust the product-by-industry use by subtracting from it the product-by-industry values for product taxes less subsidies and import duty (referred to as taxes in this section) and imports and trade  transport margins. While columns are often referred to as industries in this section, the same adjustments will be extended to the final consumption columns (PFCE, GFCE, GFCF, CIS, valuables, and exports). Taxes, trade  transport margins, and imports are reported as aggregate columns for each product; therefore, they need to be redistributed into a product x industry matrix. This redistribution occurs based on the share of use of product i by industry j in total use of product i. In the redistributed trade  transport margins matrix, we deviate from using shares for redistribution for trade and transport products (trade, railway transport, land transport, air transport, water transport, and supportive and auxiliary transport activities). This exception arises as margins for these products are reported incomes, i.e., they are negative rather than positive. We multiply the negative margins by the share of margins paid by all other non-trade and non-transport products in industry j in the total margins paid by all other products. Thus, the income from margins for trade and transport products is distributed across industries based on the share of margins paid by the users of products in those industries. An adjustment to be noted in the supply table of the SUT prior to the redistribution exercise is in the treatment of product taxes less subsidies for trade. Even though trade does report taxes and avails subsidies, as reflected in the supply table, the expectation would be that these ultimately get passed on to consumers of trade. Therefore, we redistribute taxes less subsidies, as reported in the trade row, between products that report a positive trade and transport margin on the basis of their share in total positive trade and transport margins. To ensure that the table balances itself, the changes in the product taxes less subsidies column are accounted for within the trade and transport margins column. There are four transformation models that can be adopted to arrive at an IOT from an SUT: Model A (Product technology assumption), Model B (Industry technology assumption), Model C (Fixed industry sales structure assumption), and Model D (Fixed product sales structure assumption). Model A and model B assumptions result in a product-by-product IOT, and model C and model D result in industry-by-industry IOT (Eurostat, 2008). For the purposes of our study, we adopt the industry technology assumption of model B that each industry has its own specific way of production, irrespective of its product mix. This means that we assume that each industry has its own input structure, irrespective of its different types of products. Even if the ratios/number of products in its output mix changes, the proportions of inputs required to produce the output remains consistent with the initial input structure (Eurostat, 2008). Since model Bs transformation matrix gives a product- by-product IOT, we rework the transformation matrix such that it yields an industry-by-industry IOT when multiplied with the basic-price use table. The transformation matrix is a product-by-industry matrix where each element is the share of supply of the product by the industry in the total supply of the product in the economy. The transpose of this transformation matrix is multiplied with the intermediate consumption matrix and the final consumption matrix from the basic-price use table. This multiplication results in an industry-by-industry intermediate consumption matrix where each element is a convex combination of the supply of products produced by the industry described in the row with the use of products by the industry described in the column. Therefore, each element describes the proportion of products used by the industry column that are provided by the industry row. Similarly, each element in the derived final consumption matrix is a convex combination of the share of products produced by the industry row and the quantity of final consumption of these products. The final step is to  45add the row items of taxes, imports, gross output, and gross value added for each industry. We also conduct two simple checks to assess whether the IOT is internally consistent: the sum of intermediate consumption, imports, taxes, and gross value added should equal the gross output for each industry, and the total use should equal the total output. Calculation of estimates based on the IOT ADBs methodology is based on the standard input-output framework, which uses the Leontief Inverse to represent the economy as a distribution of GVA: where is an n x 1 matrix of output for n industries of the economy, is an n x n matrix of intermediate consumption and y is an n x 1 matrix of final demand for each industry. Constructing a matrix such that where is intermediate consumption of p roducts produced by industry i by industry j and is the output of industry j, then we get: Rearranging this equation, following the rules of matrix multiplication, gives us: Pre-multiplying this equation by where , we get an equation describing the entire economys GVA. If we diagonalise the and vectors to and , we get the matrix in which represents the value- added contribution of industry i in the final demand of industry j. Using the matrix, its possible to isolate the value-added contribution of the digital industries to itself (own linkages), to non-digital sectors (forward linkages) as well as the value-added contribution of non-digital industries to digital industries (backward linkages). Extrapolating the 2019-20 IOT for 2020-21 and 2021-22 and addressing discrepancies in the NAS Since there is no SUT available for years 2020-21 and 2021-22, we extrapolate the IOTs for these years based on the structure of the 2019-20 IOT and corresponding financial year aggregates from the NAS.Industry-wise GVA and output, taxes and import duties less subsidies, imports, and final expenditure (PFCE, GFCE, GFCF, CIS, valuables, and exports of goods  services) from NAS 2020-21 and 2021-22 are used to establish the row and column totals of the corresponding 2020-21 and 2021-22 IOTs. The structure of the 2019-20 IOT (i.e., the linkages between each industryi.e., from each row to column) is used to populate the values of the new IOT based on these updated aggregate values. Each industry is share in a given industry js total use from the 2019-20 IOT is applied to the 2020-21 total use of industry j (column sum) to obtain estimates for industry js use of industry i (each cell within that column). Similarly, each industry's share in total imports, total taxes, and import duties less subsidies and total expenditure are taken from the 2019-20 SUT and updated for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 SUTs based on aggregates obtained from NAS. Aggregates from NAS: Assumptions Due to a lack of complete data on FISIM per industry as well as disaggregation for all industries in the IOT, we make certain assumptions to determine the output, FISIM-adjusted inputs, and similarly adjusted GVA for 2020-21 and 2021-22 for the 66 industries in the IOT. These assumptions differ between sectors as we attempt to mirror the allocation present in SUT 2019-20. The rationale is to, at the very least, retain consistency in the absence of accurate published data on the allocation of FISIM. The assumptions are as follows:  Minin g and quarrying sector: The initial distribution of FISIM in 2019-20 as determined from the IOT is assumed to be consistent for the following periodsto maintain consistency in distribution. First, FISIMis determined based on the 2019-20 distributionfor the non-metallic minerals  minor minerals,fuel minerals, and metallic minerals sectors.These newly determined FISIM-adjusted inputs arethen divided based on the disaggregation presentin the IOT.  C rude petroleum and natural gas: We assume that their respective share in their total output remainsthe same across the three periods. This assumptionis made due to a lack of disaggregated data fornatural gas and petroleum separately. 46  M anufacturing: We assume that the distribution of FISIM as reported in the SUT remains the same across all manufacturing sub-sectors. While thereis a possibility that FISIM should be divided basedon GVA, for consistency, we maintain the initialshare of FISIM.  F inancial and insurance services: The share of output and input have been divided based onshares as reported in the SUT27% and 73% forinput and value added for the financial sector and40% and 60% for the insurance sector.  R eal estate, ownership of dwellings, and other professional services: We deviate fromassumptions made in previous sectors regardingthe distribution of FISIM and calculate its sharesbased on the share of unadjusted GVA of sectors.An aggregate number for FISIM is provided, whichis then multiplied by the share of the GVA of thatsub sector in the sector. Balancing Discrepancies - Assumptions Both the 2019-20 IOT and the IOT for subsequent years have discrepancies between output-side aggregates and expenditure-side aggregates, consistent with those reported in the NAS, that need to be addressed to have a balanced table. In 2019-20, the NAS reported a discrepancy of INR 113,925 crore between the production side and the expenditure side, i.e., the national accounts reported a higher value for the supply of products than the use of products. This discrepancy is accounted for in the 2019-20 SUT published by MoSPI, mainly through adjustments in imports, private final consumption expenditure, change in inventories, and exports. Similarly, NAS reported a discrepancy for 2020-21 and 2021-22, albeit a negative discrepancy, indicating a higher reported number for the expenditure side than the production side. For the 2020-21 IOT, the discrepancies between the output and total use per industry are smaller than the total expenditure for each industry. Therefore, these discrepancies are adjusted between industry-wise PFCE, CIS, and exports, in that order of preference. For the 2021-22 IOT, the discrepancies are adjusted similarly, except for three industries, whose discrepancies are considerably larger than the expenditure valuescoal  lignite, non-ferrous metal ores, and other mining. For these three sectors, discrepancies are adjusted in the imports of industries that report high intermediate consumption. For coal  lignite, the imports of electricity are adjusted. This adjustment has been made because the energy balance 39 of India shows that most imports of coal are consumed by this industry. For non-ferrous metal ores, imports of the manufacture of basic iron and steel  casting of iron and steel, manufacture of basic precious and non-ferrous metals  casting of non-ferrous metals, manufacture of electrical equipments, manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products, and other manufacturing industries are adjusted. While the domestic production of non-ferrous metal ores has increased, these increases are missing for downstream non-ferrous metallic ores. 40 For other mining, the industries for which imports are adjusted are manufacture of basic iron and steel  casting of iron and steel, manufacture of basic precious and non-ferrous metals  casting of non-ferrous metals, manufacture of electrical equipments, manufacture of chemical and chemical products except pharmaceuticals, medicinal and botanical products, manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products, other manufacturing, and construction. These industries have large import values and are also large intermediate consumers of products from other mining. The adjustments per industry appear to be 5% or less than corresponding import values. Storage and warehousing do not have final demand but does report a discrepancy between the supply and use side. For this reason, storage and warehouse discrepancies have been allocated to PFCE. It should be noted that the choice of this allocation is not as important to the final estimate determined in this study because it does not affect the final value, but any analysis that tries to isolate or examine these components should consider how these allocations are done. Allocations for adjustment follow ADBs standard practice for balancing IOTs. 39Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation. (2023, March).

Two important components that separate DIPs from other online platforms as well as from traditional retail and wholesale activity, are the charging of a fee for facilitating a transaction and the absence of economic ownership of the product or service by the business facilitating the transaction. DIPs do not include social media and platforms that provide services free of charge. Lyft, an example of a DIP, facilitates the transaction by acting as an agent and does not consider itself to take ownership of the services provided. 3Data and Advertising-Driven Digital PlatformsExamples include search engines, web mapping platforms, public transport applications, mobile wallets, information sharing (e.g., sport results) applications, social media, and social networking sites 4Firms Dependent on Intermediary PlatformsProducers dependent on digital intermediary platforms are units that sell most of their goods or services via intermediation platforms. These are largely workers or contractors that source work from digital labour platforms: Online web-based platforms, where tasks or work assignments are performed online or remotely by workers before being (digitally or physically) delivered to the client) or location-based platforms, where tasks or work assignments are carried out in person in specified physical locations by workers 5 E-Tailers Traders engaged in the purchasing and reselling goods who receive most of their orders digitally 6Digital-Only Firms Providing Financial and Insurance ServicesComprises financial service providers, including insurance, reinsurance, and pension schemes and funds, which operate predominantly online, with limited or no avenues to physically interact with consumers. Also includes financial platforms that facilitate digital P2P lending and crowdfunding. 7Other Producers Only Operating DigitallyComprises units operating exclusively online that are not included in one of the previous six digital industries. Includes businesses that produce their own goods and services and interact with consumers in an exclusively digital manner. All ordering within this industry would be considered as digitally ordered, and all services within this industry would be considered digitally delivered. Examples include producers providing digital content on a subscription basis (such as digital newspaper subscriptions and audio or visual content subscriptions), online gaming and gambling services, as well as more traditional services (such as legal or accounting services) that only have a presence online. For example, it would include universities and other tertiary education providers that interact with students entirely online, where students do not have the option to attend in person and must receive their education service digitally but would exclude education providers that offer online courses in addition to in-person courses. Similarly, it would exclude newspaper publishers that sell newspapers through physical outlets such as shops and newspaper stands as well as selling via digital newspaper subscriptions, since the publisher is interacting with consumers both digitally and physically. However, if a newspaper sells its product only via digital subscriptions, it would be included in this industry even if the newspaper is delivered to the home or office of the online subscriber.

The GMV at the firm level for digital intermediaries is defined as the total value of the goods sold on the platform in a particular year. The GMV for digital intermediaries are sourced from a range of sources, including business reports, news articles, and investor presentations. The GMV includes the intermediary platform fee along with the income earned by the dependent firm. This value has to then be adjusted to subtract the portion of value accrued to the intermediary to estimate the income earned by the firms dependent on digital intermediaries. We use the average commission rates to partition out the intermediary platform fees (see Table A9). The amount that these intermediaries receive from their revenue is based on a marketplace commission rate. This is defined as the rate that is charged by the platform to the company selling their product on the platform. The marketplace commission rate differs across platforms and industries. Based on the marketplace commission rate, the revenue for the firms selling on these accordingly computed. The marketplace commission rate varied from 10 to 20 percent across industries. 45Infobeam Solution. (n.d.).

We use the average profit margins for MSMEs49 as a proxy (for calculations, see Table A10). These estimates based on profit margins serve as a proxy for GVA but do not capture compensation to employees and may not include the consumption of fixed capital and production taxes less production subsidies, which should be included as part of GVA. In that sense, it underestimates value added by businesses selling on digital platforms. To capture the income of content creators, we use YouTube as a proxy and include YouTuber income estimates to the final result. 62  Table A10: Estimated GMV and Value-added by Firms dependent on Digital Intermediaries Sector GMV (USD Bn)GMV (INR Crore)Value-Added of Firms Dependent on Digital Intermediaries (INR Crore) Food Delivery 6 48,218 7,259 Shared Mobility 11.05 88,802 62,161 Travel 9.5 76,345 10,668 E-commerce 60 4,82,181 74,678 Total 86.55 6,95,546 1,54,766 Content Creators on Youtube 16,000 GVA of firms dependent on digital intermediaries 1,70,766 Source: https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/zomato-maintains-55-food-delivery-gmv-lead-vs-swiggy-in-cy22-kotak-123062900471_1.html;https emobilityplus.com/2022/03/10/indias-shared-mobility-industry-is-likely-to-witness-revenues-of-42-85-billion-by-2027/  63 Notes to Respondents This survey is being undertaken as a part of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) project on Measuring the Size of Indias Digital Economy, being executed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).

The portion of output from the private sector is obtained from the National Accounting Division of MoSPI. From this, the revenue attributed to the companies already included in the OECD digital industries was subtracted to avoid double-counting. Then, the estimate share of revenue that was digitally estimated from the primary surveys was applied. This was calculated as the digital share weighted by firm revenue. This provided the value of digital output by sector. This was then apportioned to digital GVA by using the ratio of GVA-to-output ratio for the respective sector. This adjustment was not done for the financial services sector because NAS provides data only on value-added and not output. The estimation for the financial services sector excludes the GVA of central banks and pension funds. Calculations are provided below.

The projected values of GVA are then estimated using a constant ratio of GVA to output of 0.728. Then, a projected digital share of GVA is applied to estimate the value of digital GVA. The projected digital share is calculated by assuming that it will grow at 25% over the next 5 years, based on the most commonly selected (modal) response in the primary survey.

This presents lower bound estimates for these categories because these lists may not be exhaustive. Employment in each of the identified companies is taken from the EPFO database. Industry 4 is a lower bound estimate calculated as the number of gig platform workers in the top digital labour platforms (37,71,165), plus the number of estimated YouTube content creators with more than one lakh followers (7,50,000),52 plus the estimated employment due to online sales by other firms selling online (10,17,674).

The PLFS did not report values for NIC code 2680 in 2022-23. NIC 582 (Software Publishing) was included in the employment estimates but not in the GVA estimates because it could not be partitioned in the publicly available NAS and it is also largely captured in NIC 62 and 63. There are also fundamental differences between employment surveys and the NAS in methodology and the way industry classifications are done, due to which the actual scope may vary.NIC Code Description% in total employment (UPSS) 78  56Dunzo.

Annual survey of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in India: Leveraging e-commerce for the growth of MSMEs. ICRIER. https://icrier.org/pdf/E-commerce_MSME_Annual-Survey.pdf. Data from Figure 17 is used to calculate the average share of e-commerce sales in total sales as follows. Firms were asked to choose a range that characterizes their share of e-commerce sales. The mid-point of these ranges was weighted by the percentage of firms that report being in that range.Urban Company 45,000 Urban Company July 2024 Dunzo 11,000 Dunzo56 July 2024 BigBasket 35,565 Business Standard57December 2022 Flipkart 3,00,000 Flipkart58December 2022 Zepto 50,000 TechCrunch592024 Amazon 1,00,000 Fairwork602020 HouseJoy 65,000 Fairwork 2020 Blinkit 12,600 Fairwork 2020 Total 37,71,165 Older estimatesCompany Number of Partners Source Date The Fairwork (2020) estimates for February 2020 of these companies together (except Zepto) was 3.03 million. While overall, this is an estimate of the total number of platform gig workers, these numbers are overestimates of the number of individuals employed by these particular platforms because many of these estimates are the number of registrations, which may be larger than the number of active partners, and some of these individuals are likely to be employed by multiple platforms and therefore double-counted. The estimated employment due to online sales by other firms selling online is calculated as follows. This estimate may include some platform gig workers as well as firms selling online through means other than intermediaries and therefore may be an overestimate. The total employment by non-agricultural unincorporated firms that receive online sales is estimated based on the ASUSE 2022-23 survey (4.10% of total employment of all firms surveyed). This is applied to the employment generated by non-agricultural unincorporated firms of 11 crore, as reported in the ASUSE 2022-23 report,61 providing as estimate of employment 45,07,004 by the subset of firms selling online. The share of employment within these firms that is attributable to digital sales is calculated by assuming that it is proportionate to the share of sales received online. This percentage (22.58%) is estimated from a survey that estimates the share of e-commerce sales in total sales for MSMEs.62  79Netherlands: ICT Usage in Enterprises Netherlands survey on ICT usage by enterprises can be found here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/ metadata/Annexes/isoc_e_simsie_nl_an_2.pdf Netherlands: Resident Digital Intermediary Platform Survey These are some sample questions translated by ICRIER from the questionnaire shared by Statistics Netherlands. This questionnaire is about online platforms. Before you move on to the content part of the questionnaire, here are a few questions to verify that you are the owner of the website or app for which this survey is intended. We also check whether your website or app is indeed an online platform. An online platform is a website or app where different people, organisations, or companies come into contact with each other and can exchange goods, services, or information. The online platform usually does not offer the goods, services, or information itself, but mainly acts as an intermediary. 1) Does your website or app mediate or support the exchange of goods, services or information between individuals, companies, or organisations? This can involve mediation or support in the sale of goods, bringing residents, patients, and family together, crowdfunding, dating, new friendships, renting out accommodations, borrowing items, etc. a) Yes b) No 2) If yes, are you, or is your company or organisation, the only provider of goods, services or information on your website or app? a) Yes b) No, in addition to our own offerings, there are also offerings from other parties c) No, there is only an offer from other partiesAppendix 11: Suggested Questions from Surveys Used by other Countries If the answer to the above is b) or c), then continue to the next question. 3) In addition to the online platform indicated in the relevant line of the letter of registration, are there any other online platforms that are part of your company or organisation? a) Yes b) No 4) If yes, what are the most important other online platforms that are part of your company or organisation?

FTE (full-time equivalent): An employee who works a full week counts as one FTE. An employee who works part-time should only be counted in part. For example: an employee who works two days a week counts for 0.4 FTE (i.e. 2/5). Table Personnel Number Employees FTEs 8) Is there a clear distinction to be made between providers and buyers among the users of your online platform? In the case of platforms that focus on the exchange of goods or services, a clear distinction can often be made between those who offer the goods or services (the providers) and those who purchase them (the buyers). With platforms that focus on information or communication (such as search engines, dating sites, or social media), this distinction is often less clear.  a) Yes b) No Block: Users Users 9) How many unique users have used your platform in Reference Period?

Environment Scanning and Compet itiveness of Electronics and IT Hardware Industry 1.1. Overview of the Global Electronics Industry The global Electronics Hardware and Information Te chnology (IT) industry is valued at US  2.5 billion. Out of this, the global Electronics Hardware industry1 had a production of US  1.85 trillion in 2008. This is expected to reach US  1.86 trillion in 20092. While the industry was on a growth path, the recent rapid growth in indu stry production which was the result of strong consumer spending backed by economic expansi on in emerging economies came to a sudden halt in 2008. It is expected that 2009 would see a si ngle digit growth unlike the double digit growth witnessed in the past. The global market size and major segments are indicated below. Figure 1: World electronics hardware production an d major segments (in US  billion) Source: Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JETIA) and IMaCS analysis However, despite the current downturn, it is exp ected that the global Electronics Hardware industry has a potential to clock US  3.2 trillion3 in revenues in the next five years growing at a CAGR of about 9.5% once the economy recovers. 1 Net of IT solution services 2 Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JETIA) 3 BCC Research 250 253 256345 347 349481 479 490138 137 138231 219 216127 128 133311 288 285 0200400600800100012001400160018002000 2007 2009 (E) 2009 (F)US  billionSemiconductors Display devices Electronic components Other electronic equipment Computers and information terminals Communications equipment AV equipment Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 6 of 49 The US is the market leader with a share of 26 % followed by Japan with a share of 19%.

Skill Pyramid for the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Given that the industry would required a varied prof ile of skill sets, the following figure presents an overview of the profile of skill requirements as de rived from human resource requirements across different sectors of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 45 of 49 Figure 22: Skill Pyramid for the Elect ronics and IT Hardware Industry Source: Industry inputs, IMaCS analysis The skill pyramid, in summary, captures where th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry stands relatively in terms of skills (a function of ac tivity, educational requirements, and amount of preparatory time required to inculcate a specifi c skill) as compared to all other industries. As can be observed, Skill Levels 2 and 3 , have the highest incremental requirement of human resource. This indicates the requirement for persons trained in manufacturing, servicing, and sales functions in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. 2.6. Emerging Trends in Electronics and IT Hardware Industry and Implications on Human Resource and Skill Requirements The following are some of the emerging trends in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry:  Increasing consumption and potential for production: The expected stead y increase in the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFC E) on Home Appliances, Recreational and Education Services, both ranging between 13% and 15%, is expected to drive the consumption and production of Electronics and IT Hardware. This is expected to drive industry/production growth at about 17%, w ith major contributors being Computers, Consumer Electronics, and Telecom.  Sales and Service Ecosystem as a driver of employment: The sales and service support functions are expected to generate an incr emental employment of 1.2 million persons till 4% to 5% Skill Level 4 (skills which are highly specialised involving research and design) Skill Level 3 (skills which require long drawn preparation as demonstrated by acquisition of degrees, and involve highly technical or il i ) Skill Level 2 (skills which require technical training inputs, knowledge of complex operations and machinery, skills of supervision) Skill Level 1 (skills which can be acquired with a short/modular and focussed intervention and thereby enhancing employability of those with minimal education) 49% to 50% 25% to 27% 19% to 21% Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 46 of 49 2022. This would be due to a large nation-wi de footprint of tier-2 and tier-3 industry participants (dealers, franchisees, service agenci es, etc.). This ecosystem would contribute to a large portion of the human resource requirement.  Manufacturing has potential for increasing localisation: While a large portion of manufacturing is actually currently a combination of sourcing and assembly, increasing content would be locally manufactured  for example, passive components, certain active components, more complex motherboards, increasing adoption of Surface Mounted Technologies and other high-tech areas. Certai n components such as CRT based picture tubes may eventually see a reduction in production given the increasing adoption of LCD/Plasma displays. Incremental employment in manufacturing is likely to be 1.5 million till 2022.  Increasing adoption of E-Waste Management (electronic waste management) driven by regulation is likely to see more organi sation of the industry in that space.  Global trends such as green and energy efficient t echnology is likely to have increasing adoption in India too.  Increasing contract manufacturing an d stronger OEM-supplier relationships would also be a key success factor towards developing a bette r ecosystem. There is a strong case for cluster development in this sector.  Growing segments would be major contributors to employment: Segments such as Consumer Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecom Equipment would be major contributors for employment. Illustrative growth categories are:  Set Top Boxes  Mobile Handsets  Plasma/LCD TVs  PC assembly  End to End IT solutioning - assembling, inst allation, support at on-site and off-site, infrastructure management, emergence of newer technologies such as cloud-computing. 2.7.

BACKGROUND 1.1 F. No. W/49/2024 -IPHW .Electronics is one of the highest -traded and fastest -growing industries globally due to ongoing digitization. As digitization continues to advance, the electronics industry is expected to play a pivotal role in shap ing the global economy and advancing a country's economic and technological development. Since electronics permeates all the sector of the economy, it has cross -cutting economic and strategic importance. Its economic importance extends beyond its direct co ntribution, as it is a foundational industry that influences, supports, and enables progress in other sectors. 1.2 In CY 2022, global electronics production stood at USD 4.3 trillion. Out of this, finished electronics products accounted for approximately USD 2 .5 trillion, while electronics components contributed around USD 1.8 trillion. (Source: SP Global) 1.3 Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had notified Phased Manufacturing Programme, National Policy on Electronics 2019, and Production Linked Incentives (PLI) to boost electronics manufacturing in the country. As a result of these init iatives, the domestic production of electronic goods increased five times from  1.90 lakh crore (USD 30 Billion) in FY2014 -15 to  9.52 lakh crore in FY2023 -24 (USD 115 Bn) (industry figures) at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of more than 17%. 1.4 Furth er, the PLI scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing (LSEM) has also catalysed growth of electronics manufacturing led by mobile phones, resulting in exponential growth in electronics export from  81,822 crore in FY 2020 -21 to  2,41,157 crore in FY 2023 -24 at the CAGR of more than 43%. 1.5 Due to the success of PLI scheme for LSEM, launched in April 2020, the import of finished electronics goods has more or less remained stagnant. However, the imports of electronic components required to manufacture f inished electronics goods have increased corresponding to the growth in electronics production. 1.6 NITI in its report Electronics: Powering Indias Participation in Global Value Chain (GVC) released in July 2024 enumerates multiple challenges faced by comp onent and sub -assembly manufacturers. These are: (i) high upfront capex requirement, (ii) high investment to turnover ratio (iii) long gestation period (iv) lack of scale; and (v) catching up with technological advancements. 1.7 Therefore, for Bharat to move u p the value chain in electronics manufacturing, it is imperative to create an enabling environment for domestic manufacturing of components and sub -assemblies. Components are the heart of electronics products and constitute a significant part of the total value of the finished product. Domestic component manufacture would not only lead to significant increase in the domestic value addition but also result in savings in significant foreign exchange by reducing imports. 10 THE GAZ ETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY PART ISEC.1 1.8 Hence, a policy initiative for develo ping and manufacturing ecosystem for focused sub -assemblies and bare components of electronics is also necessary to address the factors affecting the competitiveness of component manufacturing in Bharat. 1.9 NITI Aayog in its report has also made recommendatio ns for a policy initiative in terms of fiscal interventions for component manufacture and reforms to help Bharat to create more employment in electronics manufacture. 1.10 Such policy interventions would enable domestic manufacturers to integrate with the supp ly chain partners of GVCs. This would help in achieving the desired scale and competitiveness through value addition not only meeting the domestic demand but exports as well. Further, this would also result in creation of significant employment opportuniti es for the youth in manufacturing space. 1.11 Accordingly, this scheme has been formulated to overcome the disabilities and other challenges being faced by the industry to achieve  Atmanirbharta in electronics supply chain ecosystem by offering incentives for component manufacture in Bharat. 2. ELECTRONICS COMPONEN T MANUFACTURING SCHE ME The scheme provides differentiated fiscal incentives in terms of (a) turnover linked incentive (b) capex incentive and (c) hybrid incentive i.e. combination of both (a) and (b) on target segment products, depending on the specific challenges being faced by the industry. 3. OBJECTIVE The objective of the proposed scheme is to develop robust component manufacturing ecosystem by attracting investments (global/domestic) across the valu e chain, leading to increase in Domestic Value Addition (DVA) and increase in the share of Bharats exports in global electronic trade by integrating its domestic electronic industry with the Global Value Chains (GVCs). 4.

    "content": "1 FAQs on RFP for Augmentation  Enhancement of Existing 8 -inch Fab of SCL Since the launch of the RFP on Feb 19, 2025, many potential Bidders had shared their inputs via Pre -Bid queries. SCL has taken a considerate view of these inputs and issued Corrigendum I to IV over time. To ensure that there is no gap in understanding amongst the potential bidders, the following FAQs are being published. All Bidders are requested to go through these FAQs to further their understanding of the RFP requirements and make their bid submissions accordingly. 1. How does the negotiation and Letter of Award (LoA) issuance process work after Bid acceptance? In the event of acceptance of the Bid of the Selected Bidder(s), the Authority shall invite the Selected Bidder(s) for negotiation of the terms of Contract Agreement. The Selected Bidder(s) shall inform the Authority of their preferred process of negotiation. The Selected Bidder(s) and the Authority shall then negotiate the Contract Agreement as per a mutually agreed process. Post successful negotiations of the Contract Agreement and subsequent to internal approvals, LoA will be issued to the Selected Bidder(s) as mentioned in S. No 14 of Bid Schedule . The Selected Bidder(s) on receipt of the LoA shall execute the pre viously negotiated Contract Agreement within 30 days unless the Authority consents to extension of time for executing the Contract Agreement. 2. What is the purpose of Bid Security ? Bid Security submitted in the form of Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is to safeguard against the Selected Bidder(s) no t coming forward for negotiation of the Contract Agreement or not executing the Contract Agreement post successful negotiations (i.e. post receipt of the LoA). 3. When are Bidder(s) required to submit the Earnest Mo ney Deposit (EMD)? All qualified Bidder(s) must submit the Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) along with a signed copy of an NDA with SCL before obtaining access to the Data Room and conducting Site Visit. 4. What is the duration of validity of Bid Security? The Bid Security will be valid for 12 months. In the unlikely scenario that the Contract Agreement isnt signed during this period, the Selected Bidder(s) may be asked to extend the validity of the Bid Security . 5. Under what instances will the EMD be forfei ted? As stated in Corrigendum IV dated 9th May, the only event under which the EMD will be forfeited before awarding the LoA is as follows: a) If the Bidder , having been notified of the acceptance of its Financial Bid by the Authorit y, decides not to pursue this project before commencement of the negotiation of the terms of the Contract Agreement . b) If the Selected Bidder(s) completes successful negotiations with the Authority and receives the LoA but doesn t forward to execute the previously negotiated Contract Agreement , the EMD will be forfeited. 6. Could you provide guidance on the procedure for submitting the Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) on the CPP P Portal? 2 The timeline to submit EMD was changed a s per Corrigendum III dated 11 April . All qualified Bidder(s) must submit the Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) along with a signed copy of an NDA with SCL before obtaining access to the Data Room and conducting Site Visit . However, CPPP Portal mandates EMD for successful submission of Pre-Qualification Bid. To address this , the following steps are to be followed on the CP PP Portal : a) At the Pre -Qualification Bid stage , Bidder(s) shall c heckmark EMD on the CP PP Portal b) In addition, Bidder(s) shall upload a letter citing Change in EMD submission timeline as stated in Corrigendum III dated 11 April  c) At the Financial Bid stage, Bidder(s) shall submit a declaration of submission with EMD details. A revised format of Bank Guarantee for Earnest Money Deposit, in line with the changes in Corrigendum IV , will be published later for qualified Bidder (s). 7. When is the Performance Security to be furnished? Post the negotiation of the Contract Agreement, at the time of signing of this Contract Agreement, the Selected Bidder(s) shall furnish to the Authority a Performance Security, in the form of a bank guarantee to secure its obligations under the Contract Agreement(s). 8. Can a Bidder enter into a MoU with a technology partner or provider instead of a Consortium Agreement?

Vendor-4 9 6 Page-15, Section 1.5.1 II. Detailed Engineering and Execution - scope of work The enhanced capacity of 1500WSPM will lead to extra requirement of resources from existing public civil infrastructure of the locality where SCL is situated. New plants (acidic slurry treatment, water treatment and recycling, solid waste management, sewerage system may also be required to be constructed on-site) Also, the regulations often pose risk to viability of such expansion projects. Whose scope will be the responsibility (including payments) of constructing new plants and obtaining additional environmental approvals, increased effluent discharge approvals for toxic and non-toxic chemicals, safety-codes and approvals, proximity to residential  civil area safety requirements, enhanced water,sewerage  electricity requirements, pollution compliance, dense- population risks with respect to storage of chemicals and gases  liabilities etc ? We suggest SCL should bear such responsibility and costs ( but not limited to mentioned in here) as well as all civil risk liabilities , as it requires interface with multiple government agencies. Complete scope is define in RFP. Further information can be shared after NDA with Qualified bidders. Regarding the environmental approvals from state pollution control board and other statutory approvals, SCL will bear the application fee. The selected vendor shall however provide the relevant information and liaison for renewal the consents to operate/ establish. 7 Page 17, Section 1.5.1 III. The overall scope for equipment upgrades, replacement and addition shall be completed in 3 logical stages to cause minimal disruption of fab operations and introduce step changes in cleanroom and utilities modifications There is high probability of significant downtime of the production activities during the execution of entire Package-1 and this should be acknowledged by SCL at pre-bid itself. Cleanroom disturbance is unavoidable even when minor activities related to upgradation/modification in tools, especially utilities are carried out. These stages as defined in RFP are defined to minimize disruption . Contractor should plan the movement in accordance with SCL to minimize the down time. 8 Page 19, A.General 4) Any OEM-refurbished tools must have OEM support of at least 10 years from the time of tool acceptance, and a minimum residual life of 80% at the time of shipment, as per applicable government norms A) What shall be the criterion for New/OEM- Refurbished/Non-OEM refurbished ?

SCL Reply :- Can be discussed with Qualified Bidders after NDA 45 Vendor-6 The authority will declear any bid unreasonable, impractical or unviable only within the interpretation of RFP scope of work. S. No. Points of Clarification Additionally, the terms of the RFP contain broad and vague provisions that grant SCL significant discretion in forfeiting the EMD. For example: 1. The Authority finds any Bid to be unreasonable, impractical or unviable. These terms are open to interpretation and lack clear criteria. 2. The Bidder does not provide, within the time specified by the Authority, the supplemental information sought by THE AUTHORITY for evaluation of the Bid. 3. There may be instances where the requested data is unavailable, potentially leading to forfeiture of the EMD. The Bidder is required to provide representations regarding other Bidders despite not having knowledge of them.21 We are encountering difficulties in applying to SCL RFP No. SCL/PS/45088/2025 and providing the required EMD. The RFP states: This Bid Security is to safeguard against a Bidder(s) withdrawing or altering its bid during the bid validity period. We fully agree with this requirement and intend to submit a bid. However, our bid may include observations, modifications, comments, and adjustments to certain technical requirements in the RFP. Our concern is that submitting a bid that does not fully comply with all the technical terms of the RFP may lead to the forfeiture of the EMD. Specifically: 1. The form of the bank guarantee states that the bid security can be forfeited if the bidder fails to fulfill or comply with all or any of the terms and conditions contained in the RFP. 2. Section 1.18(5)(d) of the RFP provides that the EMD may be forfeited if the bid is disqualified due to any violation of the conditions set out in the RFP. Given these provisions, it is unclear how we are expected to submit a bid while including necessary comments and modifications.Clarifications Requested SCL Reply If there are specific queries related to commercial terms, is obtaining a deviation feasible at this stage?Please refer to RFP Please refer to RFP section 1.18(4) For unsuccessful Bidders EMD will be returned post declaration of the Selected Bidder(s). Instances of Forfeiture of Bid Security is listed in section 1.18(5) where it is categorical that bidder will be only forfeit for the reason covered in section 1.7 (Conflict of Interest), section 1.9 (Rights of the Authority), section 1.10 (Fair Practices  Anti-Corruption) and any other reason which is menioned in the RFP apart from above three sction only. Also refer section 1.5.1  I (Gap Analysis  Detailed Study for Proposed Augmentation of 8-inch Line) allows Selected Bidder(s) to include necessary comments  modifications for finalization basis mutual agreement with SCL. Please refer to RFP section 1.18 (4) - For unsuccessful Bidders, EMD will be returned post declaration of the Selected Bidder(s). Instances of Forfeiture of Bid Security are listed in section 1.18(5d) wherein the Bidder will get disqualified from the RFP process for reasons covered in but not limited to section 1.7 (Conflict of Interest), section 1.9 (Rights of the Authority), section 1.10 (Fair Practices  Anti- Corruption), or any other clause in the RFP.Annexure II 1 Vendor-14 S.

The extended clean room (6\" fab-line  6 fab expansion area) has its own limitations which are as follows:  6 fab expansion area does not meet photolithograp hy equipment vibration specification. So, additional photolithography equipment cannot be pla ced in 6 fab expansion area.  Non-waffle slab can only support the equipment whi ch do not need chemical or gas delivery system in sub-fab, because the sub-fab space below non-waffle slab is already occupied and installation of gas/chemical delivery system in Sub -FAB is not possible.  Non-Waffle Slab area cannot accommodate heavy tool s (i.e having distributed load more than 300 kg/m 2) due to structural constraints  The 6\" fab clean room is presently Class-10 and is in the Bay and Chase layout.  The additional set of photolithography equipment ( similar to the existing 8\" tools) cannot be housed in present Class-10 clean rooms of 6\" FAB, d ue to their dimensions. 101 Appendix 7 : List of POCs EXHAUST POCS FEEDING 6\" TOOLS Acid /Toxic Exhaust feeding main FAB S.No. Main line/ Lateral description Location w.r.t. pillers Size of POC (inch) With Damper or W/o Damper 1 760 AEX FRP F - Main duct Sub FAB - Near F 16 Pillar 9'' With Dampe r 2 760 AEX FRP F - Main duct Sub FAB - Near crossing of 760 AEX FRP F  270 SEX 18S 8'' With Damper 3 760 AEX FRP F - Main duct Sub FAB - Near crossing of 760 AEX FRP F  270 SEX 18S 8'' With Damper 4 760 AEX FRP F - Main duct Sub FAB - Near crossing of 760 AEX FRP F  270 SEX 18S 8'' With Damper 5 500 AEX 16S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near G 16 Pillar 10'' With Damp er 6 500 AEX 16S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near G 16 Pillar 10'' With Dampe r 7 500 AEX 16S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near G 16 Pillar 9'' W/o Damper 8 500 AEX 16S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near H 16 Pillar 5'' With Damper 9 500 AEX 16S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near H 16 Pillar 2.5'' W/o Dampe r 10 500 AEX 16S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near H 16 Pillar 2'' With Damper 11 500 AEX 18S - Lateral Near G 18 Pillar 5'' W/o Damper 12 500 AEX 20S - Lateral Near G 20 Pillar 8'' With Damper 13 500 AEX 20S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near G 20 Pillar 8'' With Damper 14 500 AEX 20S - Lateral Sub FAB - Near G 20 Pillar 4'' With Damper 15 500 AEX 20S - Lateral Sub FAB - B/w G 20  H 20 Pillar 10'' W/o Damper 102 16 500 AEX 20S - Lateral Sub FAB - B/w G 20  H 20 Pillar 2'' With Damper 17 500 AEX 20S - Lateral Sub FAB - B/w G 20  H 20 Pillar 2'' W/o Damper 18 Lateral 18'' (Feeding to Post CMOS Lab) Sub FAB - B/w G 20  G 22 4'' With Damper 19 Lateral 18'' (Feeding to Post CMOS Lab) Grey area of Post CMOS lab 10\" - 02 nos.

There are two modes of offline verification, viz the Secure QR Code (displayed on Aadhaar letter, e -Aadhaar, Aadhaar PVC card and m -Aadhaar ) and the Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC XML (downloaded from the UIDAI website and m -Aadhaar ). Both the Secure QR Code and the Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC XML contain the residents data that is digitally signed by UIDAI. This is an essential security component that establish es the authenticity of the document , as presented by the resident seeking service from an OVSE. Scanning of secure QR code ( which includes validation of UIDAIs digital signature) is possible using Aadhaar Secure QR code scanner application. This scanner application is freely available for both Android and iOS based mobile phones as well as Wi ndows based applications . The scanner is also available as part of UIDAIs m - Aadhaar mobile application , for both Android and iOS phones . 3.

Procedural Guidelines of PayOnline :  The Departments would have to provide data including fee list, bill details, unique customer identifier (Customer ID, Bill No. etc.) and other relevant details to enable payments through the PAYONLINE .  PAYONLINE would prescribe common data f ormats for customer and fee list data exchange as well as transaction level data which would apply to all Departments .

PPP is a mode of implementing government programme/ schemes in partnership with the private sector. The term private in PPP encompasses all non -government agencies inclu ding corporate sectors, voluntary organizations, self help groups etc. The PPP options may be worked out for the full or the part services components (For example: citizen facilitation centers through PPP, citizen grievances system through PPP, etc. A broad range of alternatives exist for PPP mod els which may be followed by implementing agency . The options range along a continuum within the extreme of almost complete ownership and responsibility of operations, maintenance, capital investment and commercia l risk with the public sector through joint responsibility to complete private responsibility. For example, some of the approaches currently being adopted for PPP in e -Governance include: (i) Fee Based Approach : Under this approach the private party would make an initial investment in setting up systems and structures and in return would be allowed to fix nominal charges (in consultation with government) for public services to be collected either from government or public, e.g. Collecting nominal charges for issuance of birth certificate, death certificate etc. (ii) Cost Saving Approach : This approach is specifically used where the Government brings about substantial changes in existing processes through extens ive Government process reforms and use of information technology, which leads to large scale of savings in terms of staff and real estate. Under this approach the private party provides the initial investment along with their management expertise and in Page 23 of Annexure 1 return they are entitled to share of the cost saved, e.g. cost saving due to online processing of property transfer and registration document can be shared. (iii) Advertising  Sponsorship Fee Approach : Under this approach, the government may collect fees i n exchange for direct advertising by a private company on a government website, indirect marketing (by tracking user spending habits on the government website and beyond) or by sponsorship arrangements. The advertising arrangements could be based upon a me asurable outcome, such as the number of users who either visit or purchase items from the website advertised. (iv) Full Service Approach: Under this approach, the private sector is hired as a contractor to take over certain responsibilities of the Governm ent, and may retain staff on the governments behalf, in return for a fee. (v) Shared Revenue Approach : The shared revenue approach is adopted where there are ways in which the government may generate new revenue from enhanced services. This increased re venue can be used as a way to offset project costs, or finance the investment made by the private sector. If any PPP model is adopted for delivery of services under the project, the following aspects of the model must be clearly stated in the DPR: (i) Business Model: The business model for the proposed PPP should clearly be explained in the areas of:  Service deployment plan  Demand projections and price elasticity of demand  Fees and fee setting mechanism  Revenue projections for the operator  Estimated i nvestment (including phasing of investment) and operating costs  Proposed cost sharing arrangements between state, centre and private participant (ii) Key Design: The key design features of the implementation that affect the overall cost/revenue model for potential private partners must clearly be explained in the areas of:  IPRs  Change management  Service level agreements  Security requirements Page 24 of Annexure 1  Confidentiality requirements  Business continuity requirements  Termination provisions (iii) Financial Analysis:  Provide net cash flow and net present value (if applicable)  Cost benefit analysis of the PPP  Sensitivity analysis (i.e. an analysis of how some key occurrences impact project sustainability should be carried out for the Project.) (iv) Feasibility Management: Feasibility Management should provide clear information concerning all existing and expected factors, which may support or oppose the implementation of the PPP options. Feasibility management of all PPP options requires:  Analy sis of a government commitment and community support for a certain option;  Well -researched and negotiated legal contract  Strong regulatory and institutional environment  Analysis of the state of the utility, existing regulation, financial viability and risk s.

Calculation of Risk Measure: For each risk identified in above section, the DPR have to analyse the risk by considering the range of potential consequences in terms of cost, schedule and/or performance etc. and how likely they are to occur. A risk asse ssment matrix has to be prepared combining the c consequence and likelihood and thus the estimated level of risk have to be calculated and detailed out adequately in this section. Risk Measure (Threat Impact)  (Likelihood of Exploitation). The Values of the Risk Measure can be classified as High, Medium; Low based on the Risk Measure Table 11 as shown below: Page 31 of Annexure 1 Table 11: Calculation of Risk Measure B. Risk Mitigation Risk Mitigation Strategy based on Risk Evaluation Matrix The DPR have to provide a Risk Mitigation plan, specific management action plan that includes consideration of funding. The Table 12 below will help the implementing agency to understand the different categories of the risk identified. C.

These risks required further action to be mitigated . The risks have to be prioritized and mitigation plan has to be prepared . Risk mitigation plan has to be mo nitored with timelines and MIS format for reporting should be included. 3, 4 Medium Materialization of the threat (on the asset) will have a moderate business impact. These risks require further action to be mitigated. The risks have to be prioritized and mitigation plan has to be prepared . Risk mitigation plan has to be mo nitored with timelines and MIS format for reporting should be included. 1, 2 Low Impl ementing agency to take a stand to either accept risk or devi se mitigation plan. The cost benefit analysis should be supported alongwith. The risks those have been accepted have to be monitored. A monitoring plan with timelines and MIS format for reporting should be included It is very important to keep monitoring risks on periodic basis. Risk Monitoring is therefore the process That systematically tracks and evaluates the performance of risk handling actions against established metrics throughout the project. During risk mo nitoring meetings, existing risks as well as new risks are reviewed and discussed in details by the Project Team. Page 33 of Annexure 1 X. MONITORING  EVALUATION Having detailed out all components of the project as provided in the previous sections, it is essential to have details about controlling of the project at various stages initiation, development and implementation. In this section, the DPR will provide det ails about the indicators for assessment of success / failure and means of their verification. The DPR should provide details of the program monitoring plan, and reporting mechanism. The program evaluation plan should be prepared by implementing agency which will essentially cover the baseline surveys (starting line against which performance will be evaluated) and end line surveys (status of indicators after implementation has been done). A. Monitoring a) Program Monitoring Plan In this section the DPR have to identify  What does the implementing agency want to monitor (For Example: Activity, Sub Activity, Timelines, milestones, quality, Human Resources and Training, issue and deviations etc.)  During which stage of the program the implementing agency want to mon itor the above identified activities (For example: Pre -implementation stage, Implementation stage etc)  Explain the different criteria considered while carrying out the monitoring (For example: Monitoring the program progress against the defined milestones)  What will be the different methods to be used by the implementing agency for collecting data (For example: Surveys, interviews, team meeting, project review, feedback, questionnaire etc.)  At what frequency will the implementing agency be carry ing out the monitoring process during the different phases of the program identified (For example: Monthly, quarterly, Half -yearly, yearly etc.)  What will be the cost incurred for the monitoring process (A cost benefit analysis needs to be carried out by the implementing agency so that there is not cost over run of the program due to monitoring process. However the implementing agency have to keep in mind that an effective and efficient monitoring should be in place so that there is no compromise in terms of cost/ time/ quality) To carry out the monitoring and evaluation there has to be an overseeing committee. The implementing agency has to specify the monitoring and evaluation roles and responsibilities structure. Page 34 of Annexure 1 b) Reporting Mechanism (Please Note: The data collected through the various means and mechanisms need to be reported/ compiled in a pre -defined format to ensure consistency.)  The different types of reports to be generated by the implementing agency as a part of Monitoring and evaluation.  The implementing agency has to identify the different types of review mechanisms with in team also mention the timelines for the same. An ill ustrative MIS for review mechanism has been depicted in Table 1 8. Table 1 8: Illustrative MIS for Review Mechanism Action Daily Weekly Monthly Quarterly Informal discussions with team Staff meetings with managers Project review meetings with team Status report Team building activity Report to management etc. The implementing agency has to prepare milestone reports as follows to track the timelines for the various activities.
