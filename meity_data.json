All Sectionis and Divisions in DeitY 6. Intra DeitY DOs Do remember that women have the following fundamental rights under constitution : -Right to Gender equality Right against discrimination on grounds of sex -Right to practice any profession or to carry out any occupation, trade or business -Right to Life and Liberty They must be taken care of in work places. Do remember that the Constitution of India requires the State to make provisions for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. Provide for the same in the work places for the working women. DONTs Dont infringe the fundamental rights of women, as they are enforceable under Article 32 of the Constitution and hence, attract legal action. Dont crib special provisions made for women because they are made within the ambit of the Constitution of India. As per Section 66 of the Factories Act, no woman shall be required or allowed to work in any factory except between the hours of 6.00 A.M. and 7 P.M. Do not forget to show due courtesies towards female employees and colleagues. No employee should ever indulge in sexual harassment of a woman employee at the work place. If you do, you will be liable for disciplinary proceedings. For this : Dont indulge in physical contact and advance directly or indirectly, towards woman employees. Otherwise, it would amount to sexual harassment. DOs Do remember that the constitution also makes it the duty of every citizen of India to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women. Guard against the same. Do always endeavor to create and sustain conducive environment for work. Do remember that all of us have a collective responsibility to protect our Human Rights and eradicate behavior, which is unacceptable and discriminatory. Womens rights are human rights. Ensure adequate personal security for employees specially women. Do take appropriate steps at the work place to prevent sexual harassment. DONTs Dont ever pass sexually colored remarks on woman employees. No employee should ever show or attempt to show directly or by implication pornography to any woman employee. It would amount to sexual harassment of a woman employee. Dont ever indulge in any unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature with any woman employee. Any such behavior amounts to sexual harassment of a woman employee. Do not treat women employees as sex objects. Do not place women employees at disadvantageous position in connection with their employment. Article 51A(e) of the Constitution imposes on every citizen by way of fundamental duty the responsibility to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women. The Honorable Supreme Court passed judgment in the case of Vishaka and Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan Ors., AIR 1997 SC 3012, wherein sexual harassment has been defined as under: Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behavior whether directly or by implication, as :/ Physical contact and advances; demand or request for sexual favors; sexually colored remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature. DOs: Do take all steps necessary and reasonable to assist the affected person in terms of support and preventive action where sexual harassment occurs as a result of an act or omission by any third party or outsider. The victims of sexual harassment should have the option either to seek transfer of the perpetrator or their own transfer. Do remember that sexual harassment of woman has been held as violation of her fundamental right by the Honble Supreme Court 13 and hence, is justifiable (violation can be challenged in Courts). Sexual harassment is a disciplinary offence as per the Supreme Court. Hence, the rules/regulations and standing orders relating to conduct and discipline of the employees need to be amended for taking departmental , action in such cases. The Company has a Complaint Committee, to deal with cases of harassment of Women Employees with designated coordinators at branch offices. Anybody having a complaint can approach it. Besides departmental action, for sexual harassment, the Disciplinary Authority must not miss to invoke criminal remedy under the Indian Penal Code: -Assault or use of criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty is a cognizable offence under Section 354 with laid down punishment of imprisonment for 2 years or fine or both. -Uttering any word or making any gesture intended to insult the modesty of a woman is a cognizable offence under Section 509 with punishment of simple imprisonment for 1 year or fine or both. Dont make a baseless complaint of harassment. That will adversely affect the credibility of the complainant in particular and the dignity of women in general. DONTs Dont hesitate to pinpoint and suggest improvement wherever you find cumbersome procedures, which may provide opportunities for corruption and mal-practices. Dont forget that corruption corrodes the good image of your Organization. Eliminate the same. Dont show slacking towards any infringement of rules and regulations of the Company. Take immediate preventive or punitive action, as the situation demands. Dont forget that your vigilance can help the company to plug pilferage, wastage of resources, leakage and other unproductive activities, and thus, lead it to achieve its goals, in the process. Dont be too close to any particular employee or junior otherwise, your impartiality can be questioned. Dont hesitate to take firm action when cases of lack of integrity come to notice. Dont forget to submit your own Property Returns in time. DOs Always complete investigations with reasonable speed and in an objective manner in order to command confidence of the employees about the judicious working of the organization. Consider Vigilance Deptt. as a friend of the Organization and extend your whole-hearted cooperation. Remember that prevention is better than cure and prevention of corruption is better than the post-corruption hunt for the guilty. Therefore, for sensitizing the public about corruption, Chief Vigilance Commissiondesires all Organizations under its purview to display a standard notice board at the reception of the office, containing the following message in English and in the vernacular languages:Do not pay bribes. If anybody of this office asks for bribe or if you have any information on corruption in this office or if you are a victim of corruption in this office, you can complain to the Head of this Department or the Chief Vigilance Officer and the Central Vigilance Commission (Name, complete address and telephone numbers have also to be mentioned against each). Remember, problems start where vigilance ends. DONTs Dont ever forget that all decisions should be in the interest of the organization and taken on bona fide reasons. Minor procedural irregularities can be overlooked, but arbitrariness should be avoided. But dont forget to record the reasons for procedural deviations. Dont miss to take note of any aspect of a subordinates conduct, like style of living or lavish entertainment from persons with whom he has official dealings, which may give rise to suspicion with respect to his integrity. Dont pass ambiguous orders. They are the breeding grounds for irregularities. You should not dread the Vigilance Department. Truly speaking, Vigilance Department is a friend of all honest people.

    "content": "DOs Always remember that customer is the profit, everything else is overhead. Therefore, any successful organization has the customer as its focus. Remember that selling is an art -sellers enthusiasm, innovative ideas are some of the essential ingredients. Profit is the driving force that spurs us on. It is the material yardstick of success in business. But putting profit before better quality and service is like putting the carriage before the horse -business does not move.

    "content": "DOs Raw materials and consumables should be procured as per the approved budget/production programme/Bill of Materials (BOM) efficiently and economically from the right source, at the right time and of right quality in order to ensure uninterrupted production. While issuing an indent, it is the responsibility of the indenter to take into account stock position in the production floor as also in the stores, work in progress (WIP), consumption rate, correct specification of the material, existence of budget provision, lead times etc. If the quantity ordered is much more than L-1 alone can supply, the quantity may be distributed in such a way that the purchase is done in a fair, transparent and equitable manner. Deliveries of all high cost and high volume items should be staggered wherever possible to ensure that inventories are within the specified norm. DONTs The opening of quotes after the due date should not be delayed. Dont miss to evaluate the consumption pattern of an item before placing indent for its procurement. Quotes received in a format other than as specified in the tender/request for quotation (RFQ) should not be considered. Dont follow post tender negotiation because the Central Vigilance Commission has banned all post tender negotiations with immediate effect except in the case of negotiations with L-1 (i.e. Lowest Tender) with exception, however, concerning the purchase preference policy of the Government regarding the Public Sector Enterprises. Nevertheless, under its shield, the PSUs should not be made conduits for getting costly inputs or for improper purchases. Dont forget to seek the approval of the purchase proposals from the Competent Authority before issuing the Purchase Order. DOs Indents, which are complete in all respects, should only be accepted for processing. Incomplete indents should be returned to the concerned user department with a request to provide complete information. It should be ensured that enquiries issued to vendors give technical specifications of the goods clearly and also indicate relevant commercial terms and conditions. The enquiries should also indicate clearly the last date of submission of quotes and must insist on submission of quotes in a sealed cover with the reference no. of the enquiry and the last date of submission super-scribed on the same. Different types of tendering Single, Limited, Public and Global should be resorted to as per the norms laid down by the Company. The new vendors /subcontractors dealing with the Company must be approved by a designated committee as per the Purchase Procedures (P.P.) of the Company. DONTs Dont forget to put serial number on pages of purchase file before sending it to other Department (s). Dont call quotations on the ground of created urgency. Never refuse or allow delay tactics in supply of tender documents. Dont keep a file pending for decision by the Approving Authority after the recommendations of the tender committee have been received. Dont forget to keep the concerned Departments informed of the delivery schedules so that they may plan their work-schedule accordingly. For any recurring type of consumable items, it is not proper to procure the same in piecemeal manner from whatever source. Better go for rate contracts. Dont forget that no repeat order can be given at the same rate, terms and conditions, as agreed upon at the time of initial order, after six months, for which fresh quotations need to be called for. Dont give any advance intimation of the indent requirements to friendly parties. Never include dummy firms to increase the number of parties. DOs The quotes should be invited (especially for raw materials) from the registered/approved vendors. The quotes should be opened immediately after the last date of receipt of quotes is over as per procedure given in the Co.s Purchase Procedures . List of approved vendors should be appraised bi-annually by the designated committee so as to update the same once every year in accordance with the vendor appraisal procedure as given in the Co.s Purchase Procedures. Vendors should be given adequate time, as specified in the Companys P.M., to submit quotes. This time limit may be reduced, if the reasons for the same are strong, which should be recorded clearly in the file. Purchase Order should be placed on technically acceptable and lowest vendor based on evaluation of quotes submitted by vendors. Do ensure that whenever needed, the subcontractors are to be engaged only with the approval of the Sub-Contract Appointment Committee as per Companys Purchase Manual. Procurement of materials on proprietorship basis should be made, based on indents, which are accompanied with a proprietary certificate from the user department as per guidelines given in the Companys Purchase Procedure. DONTs Incoming material must not be used, processed or made available to the manufacturing floor until it has successfully passed the Incoming Goods Inspection (IGI). Dont accept material, which is not strictly as per the specifications, and wherever the material supplied is of any inferior specifications but acceptable on technical grounds, the same too should not be accepted till financial implications thereof are sorted out and prior concurrence of Competent Authority is taken. Dont make cash purchases beyond the limits fixed by the Company. Dont give tender documents of approved parties to one party, as it would lead to manipulations. Dont forget that any amendment to the Purchase Order (except for a small variation as provided in the Purchase Manual) is to be initiated by the Materials Management Department and must go through the similar cycle of approval as the purchase proposal. Dont forget that procurement proposal of capital equipment of value more than Rupees One Lakh must be approved by a standing Technical Committee duly constituted by the Competent Authority. DOs Do maintain all records and generate various reports for effective performance of purchase function. All documents in the purchase files should be serially numbered. For materials of limited shelf life, efforts should be made to get the vendors ship these materials from their latest manufacturing lots and deliveries of such materials should be phased in such a way that these materials are normally consumed before their expiry dates. DONTs Dont miss to undertake periodic review of the systems and procedures and suggest improvement/change, wherever needed.

Environment Scanning and Compet itiveness of Electronics and IT Hardware Industry 1.1. Overview of the Global Electronics Industry The global Electronics Hardware and Information Te chnology (IT) industry is valued at US  2.5 billion. Out of this, the global Electronics Hardware industry1 had a production of US  1.85 trillion in 2008. This is expected to reach US  1.86 trillion in 20092. While the industry was on a growth path, the recent rapid growth in indu stry production which was the result of strong consumer spending backed by economic expansi on in emerging economies came to a sudden halt in 2008. It is expected that 2009 would see a si ngle digit growth unlike the double digit growth witnessed in the past. The global market size and major segments are indicated below.

Skill Pyramid for the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Given that the industry would required a varied prof ile of skill sets, the following figure presents an overview of the profile of skill requirements as de rived from human resource requirements across different sectors of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 45 of 49 Figure 22: Skill Pyramid for the Elect ronics and IT Hardware Industry Source: Industry inputs, IMaCS analysis The skill pyramid, in summary, captures where th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry stands relatively in terms of skills (a function of ac tivity, educational requirements, and amount of preparatory time required to inculcate a specifi c skill) as compared to all other industries. As can be observed, Skill Levels 2 and 3 , have the highest incremental requirement of human resource. This indicates the requirement for persons trained in manufacturing, servicing, and sales functions in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. 2.6. Emerging Trends in Electronics and IT Hardware Industry and Implications on Human Resource and Skill Requirements The following are some of the emerging trends in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry:  Increasing consumption and potential for production: The expected stead y increase in the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFC E) on Home Appliances, Recreational and Education Services, both ranging between 13% and 15%, is expected to drive the consumption and production of Electronics and IT Hardware. This is expected to drive industry/production growth at about 17%, w ith major contributors being Computers, Consumer Electronics, and Telecom.  Sales and Service Ecosystem as a driver of employment: The sales and service support functions are expected to generate an incr emental employment of 1.2 million persons till 4% to 5% Skill Level 4 (skills which are highly specialised involving research and design) Skill Level 3 (skills which require long drawn preparation as demonstrated by acquisition of degrees, and involve highly technical or il i ) Skill Level 2 (skills which require technical training inputs, knowledge of complex operations and machinery, skills of supervision) Skill Level 1 (skills which can be acquired with a short/modular and focussed intervention and thereby enhancing employability of those with minimal education) 49% to 50% 25% to 27% 19% to 21% Human Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry Page 46 of 49 2022. This would be due to a large nation-wi de footprint of tier-2 and tier-3 industry participants (dealers, franchisees, service agenci es, etc.). This ecosystem would contribute to a large portion of the human resource requirement.  Manufacturing has potential for increasing localisation: While a large portion of manufacturing is actually currently a combination of sourcing and assembly, increasing content would be locally manufactured  for example, passive components, certain active components, more complex motherboards, increasing adoption of Surface Mounted Technologies and other high-tech areas. Certai n components such as CRT based picture tubes may eventually see a reduction in production given the increasing adoption of LCD/Plasma displays. Incremental employment in manufacturing is likely to be 1.5 million till 2022.  Increasing adoption of E-Waste Management (electronic waste management) driven by regulation is likely to see more organi sation of the industry in that space.  Global trends such as green and energy efficient t echnology is likely to have increasing adoption in India too.  Increasing contract manufacturing an d stronger OEM-supplier relationships would also be a key success factor towards developing a bette r ecosystem. There is a strong case for cluster development in this sector.  Growing segments would be major contributors to employment: Segments such as Consumer Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecom Equipment would be major contributors for employment. Illustrative growth categories are:  Set Top Boxes  Mobile Handsets  Plasma/LCD TVs  PC assembly  End to End IT solutioning - assembling, inst allation, support at on-site and off-site, infrastructure management, emergence of newer technologies such as cloud-computing. 2.7.

According to the State of Indias Digital Economy Report 2024, India is the third largest digitalised country in the world in terms of economy-wide digitalisation and 12th among the G20 countries in the level of digitalisation of individual users. Yet, there are no credible and up-to-date estimates on the contribution of the digital economy to national income and employment. Quantifying and understanding the role of the digital economy in driving economic growth, employment, and sustainable development are essential for both policymakers and the private sector. This can help align resources and adopt appropriate growth strategies. However, the cross-cutting and integrated nature of digital technologies makes the concept of a distinct digital economy difficult to define and measure. Moreover, the conventional system of national accounts does not lend itself directly to the measurement of the new economy. The problem is not unique to India. Few countries have attempted to size up their digital economy and even these efforts are works in progress. This report uses globally adopted methodologies frameworks developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)to estimate the size of Indias digital economy, both as a share of national income and total employment. With the publication of these numbers, India will be among a handful of countries, and the first among developing countries, to have used the OECD framework to produce the most up-to-date estimate for the size of its digital economy. The report goes beyond the OECD approach to also include the digital share of traditional industries like trade, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and education. Our estimates are based on a triangulation of data from multiple sources, including data published by the national 1 The estimates in this report are for 2022-23, which is the latest year for which disaggregated national accounts data are available.Executive Summary accounts division (NAD) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) database, CMIE Prowess, Tracxn, Employees Provident Fund Organisations Establishment Search portal, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), and various market studies, industry reports, and compa ny annual reports. In addition, we u ndertook a survey, held focus-group discussions, and consulted extensively with industry experts a nd company officials while preparing this report. We estimate that Indias digital economy stood at 11.74% of the national income in 2022-23 and is likely to rise to 13.42% by 2024-25.1 In absolute numbers, the digital economy in 2022-23 w as equivalent to INR 28.94 lakh crore (USD 368 billion) in GVA and INR 31.64 lakh crore ( USD 402 billion) in GDP. While the traditional ICT sector remains the largest component of the digital economy, digital platforms and the digitalisation of brick-and-mortar sectors are growing rapidly. The digitally enabling industry, which includes sectors such as information and communication related services, telecommunication (traditionally referred to as the ICT sector), and manufacturing of electr onic components, computers, and communication equipment, is the highest contributor, accounting for 7.83% of GVA. The new digital industries, which include Big Tech players, other digital platforms and intermediaries, and firms depend ent on digital intermediaries, account for nearly 2% of GVA. The digital contribution of three traditional industries (BFSI, trade, and education), which are not part of the OEC D framework but are included in our estimates, amounts to 2% of national GVA, rivalling in importance to the new digital industries. This is a clear indication that Indias digital economy is stead ily moving beyond the realm of the ICT industries, diffus ing across all parts of the economy through digital platforms and the digitalisation of brick-and-mortar sectors. 14  Based on our projections, Indias digital economy is expected to grow almost twice as fast as the overall economy, contributing to near ly one-fifth of national income by 2029-30. This means that, in less than six-years, the share of digital economy will become larger than that of agriculture or manufacturing in the coun try. In the short run, the highes t growth is likely to come from the growth of digi tal intermediaries and platforms, followed by higher digital diffusion and digitalisation of the rest of the economy. This will eventually lower the share of digitally enabling ICT industries in the digital econ omy. In 2022-23, the digital economy accounted for 14.67 million workers, or 2.55% of Indias estimated work force. In comparison, agriculture accounted for 263.6 million (or 45.8% of total workforce), while manufacturing employed 65.6 milli on workers (or 11.4% of workforce). Our estima tion of the workforce is based on the same definitio n and scope as that for the digital economy GVA, implying tha t the digital economy is five times more productive , whe re productivity is measured by output-worker ratio, than the rest of the economy. This report is an attempt to compi le the first set of credible, comprehensibl e, and current estimates of Indias digital economy, based on the OECD framework, that is likely to be recommended to the System of National Accounts (SNA) update for 2025. There is significant scope to improve the estimates reported here through the better utilisation of existing data as well as closing data gaps. The latter can be divided into two broad categories: data that exists but has not been compiled or matched; and data that does not exist. With the methodology and data presented in this rep or t , t he gover nment has a re a d y temp late to p ro duce periodic updates and expand the measurement of the digital economy. Our recommendations focus on three main areas: (i) narrowing data gaps, both by collating and harmonising available data and collecting new data on the digital activities of enterprises and individuals; (ii) using new data to build digital SUTs that can enable the visibility of digitalisation in macroeconomic statistics; and (iii) engaging with the OECD to improve the measurement framework and facilitate global alignment. The report provides specific recommendations to improve the quality and coverage of national statistics pertaining to the digital economy as well as suggestions to accelerate the digitalisation of Indias economy.  15 The scope and speed of digitalisation in India has been remarkable in recent years. India has the worlds second largest mobile and internet network by number of users. Few countries see data traffic per smartphone as high as in India. The country has rolled out 5G faster than in other countries. It is also the global leader in terms of the volume of digital transactions and export of ICT services. India has become the largest contributor to global GitHub AI project, and ranks third in the number of homegrown unicorns (see Box 1). During its G20 Presidency, India was recognised as the champion of digital public infrastructures (DPIs) and is also seen as a well-established digital powerhouse.

While the depth and breadth of Indias digitalisation can be measured through various indicators of connectivity, adoption of digital services, and investment in new technologies, these factors cannot help ascertain its contributions to macro-aggregates, such as its share in the GDP and Box 1: Indias Digital Strides Mobile subscription: Of the latest estimated 8.36 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide, 1.78 billion are in China, followed by 1.14 billion in India and 372 million in the US.

Quantifying and understanding the role of the digital economy in driving economic growth, employment, and sustainable development is essential for both policymakers and the private sector to align resources and adopt strategies. Doing this requires a robust measurement system that enables continued estimation and monitoring. Previous studies by researchers and statistical and multilateral agencies have not yielded satisfactory results. The current system of national accounts does not lend itself directly to the measurement of the digital economy. A key challenge is defining its scope. The increasingly cross-cutting and integrated nature of digital technologies makes the concept of a distinct digital economy difficult to define. The second key challenge is the scarcity of appropriate and granular data, which poses a potential trade-off between accuracy and completeness in capturing the digital economy. The problem is not unique to India. Few countries have attempted to size up the digital economy, and even these efforts are works in progress. Appendix 1 provides a review of methodologies and their corresponding estimates across countries that have 6 Asian Development Bank. (2021).

Retrieved from https://www.adb.org/ sites/default/files/publication/722366/capturing-digital-economy-measurement-framework.pdfattempted to measure their digital economies. This report uses globally adopted methodologiesi.e., frameworks developed by the OECD and ADBto provide estimates of Indias digital economy, both as a share of GVA/GDP and employment. 6 Our study builds on previous work done by RBI and MoSPI. The most recent estimate of Indias digital economy (Gajbhiye et al., 2022), which showed 8.5% of GVA in 2019, was based on the ADB framework using the input-output tables prepared by ADB. Anjoy et al. (2022) estimated the size of the digital economy in 2017-18 to be 7.38% of GVA through measuring employment in digital occupations and labour-input across 65 sectors using national accounts data and the PLFS 2017-18. Singh et al. (2022) presented an estimate of 7% of GVA in 2020-21 for ICT goods and services. They also broadened the scope of measurement by using machine-learning techniques to classify digital and brick-and-mortar companies. With the publication of this report, India will become among a handful of countries, and the first developing country, to provide a comprehensive and up to-date measurements of the digital economy, including new digital businesses and platforms.  17New approaches for measuring a new economy There are two popular approaches to measure the digital economy, one proposed by the ADB and the other by the OECD, respectively. The one laid out by the ADB uses the input-output analysis to estimate the value-added contribution of the digital industry and the share of the non-digital industries that enables production in the digital industry. 7 This approach equates the digital industry with the ICT industries, presenting a narrow scope of digitalisation. Specifically, the ADB approach does not fully or explicitly account for the activities of digital platforms and intermediaries or benefits to the downstream activities supported by them, such as the income and employment created by MSMEs selling on these platforms. The OECD approach, which is increasingly accepted globally, expands the scope of the digital economy to non-ICT industries. 8 The OECD framework focuses on two aspects of transactions in non-ICT industries: whether goods and services are digitally ordered or digitally delivered. It also defines new digital industries to include digital platforms and digital intermediaries, e-tailers, and financial service providers that operate digitally. 9 While the OECD approach is more accurate and intuitive, it also requires high-quality primary data; therefore, its implementation can be both expensive and time consuming. Most existing estimates for India are based on the ADB approach. This is the first study to estimate the Approach to Measurement 7 OECDs digital SUT framework is recommended to be included in the 2025 update of the System of National Accounts (SNA), the internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity 8 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

For appropriate international and domestic comparison, this study provides three estimates: (i) based on the ADB approach; (ii) based on the OECD approach; and (iii) the OECD augmented approach. As the ADB approach is narrower in scope and the global consensus gravitates towards the OECD approach, the main text of the report will focus on the OECD methodology and estimates, with the ADB approach and estimations presented in Appendix 2. Given the data limitations associated with developing digital Supply Use Tables (SUT) for India, this study estimates one of the high-priority indicators recommended by OECD, i.e., digital industries GVA and its components. 10 Our augmented approach goes beyond the OECD to estimate the digital share of three non-digital industries that have been significantly disrupted by digitalisation: trade, BFSI, and education. OECD approach The OECDs approach is based on the ways in which digital technologies are used to create value for industries, i.e., while producing, ordering, and delivering goods and services. Accordingly, it defines seven digital industries: (i) digitally enabling industries (DEIs); (ii) digital intermediary platforms charging a fee; (iii) data and advertising driven digital platforms; (iv) firms dependent on intermediary platforms; (v) e-tailers; (vi) digital-only firms providing financial and insuranceservices; and (vii) other producers only operatingdigitally. These categories are summarised in Figure 1. 18  Digitally Enabling Industry (DEI)Digital Intermediary Platforms (primarily fee-based)Digital Intermediary Platforms (primarily ad revenue -based)Firms dependent on intermediary platformsDigital only firms providing financial and insurance servicesOther producers operating only digitallyE-tailers OECD 3 OECD 6 OECD 2 OECD 5 OECD 4 OECD 7 OECD 1Figure 1: Digital Industries as Classified in the OECD Framework While the OECD 1 classification, i.e., DEI, is straightforward and its output is directly computable from the national accounts, the scope of other digital industries (i.e., OECD 2-7, excluding 4) has to be defined at the firm level. As shown in Table 1, we used four characteristics of digital transactions to classify firms into OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. These characteristics are: (i) revenue modelsubscription or advertisementbased; (ii) intermediation or ownership of goods andservices being provided; (iii) products/services beingdigitally or physically ordered; and (iv) products/services being digitally or physically delivered. Firms in all industries take digital orders, but goods and services may not be digitally delivered. These characteristics help distinguish between the OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 classifications. OECD 4 is self-explanatory, as it includes the income of individuals and businessesincluding small manufacturers, home-based entrepreneurs, gig workers, delivery partners, contracted drivers, content creators, and influencerswho depend on these digital platforms. For detailed OECD definitions of the seven industries, see Appendix 3.

There are several examples of e-sellers in India, including Country Delight, Treebo, and House of Ganges.  19The OECD approach uses these seven industry categories to create digital SUTs for an estimation of the digital economy. Conventional SUTs provided by national statistics agencies, are disaggregated to reallocate domestic output and intermediate use of industries to the new digital industries defined by OECD. This disaggregation and rebalancing exercise requires detailed information on digital transaction type and volume for each industry, which are usually collected through government enterprise surveys. The OECD itself admits that this might be an ambitious ask from countries. Accordingly, the Informal Advisory Group on Measuring GDP in a Digitalised economy proposed a set of high-priority indicators that can help coordinate initial results across countries. Countries like Canada, US, Sweden, Japan, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Netherlands have attempted to measure their digital economy using the OECD framework, but their coverage has varied widely. USs BEA defines some digital activities from the OECD guidelines, namely, infrastructure, e-commerce, and priced digital services, which are mapped back to their industries. 11,12 Canada and Australia both follow approaches similar to that of US.13,14 Canada published its initial set of SUTs in 2020, which are currently being revised and updated. 15 Netherlands and Sweden produced their updated digital SUTs in 2021.16 The OECD recommends publishing high-priority indicators and digital SUTs, even if they are experimental. 17 In the absence of detailed information on transaction type and digital volume at the sector level in India, creating a digital SUT is not feasible. There is not adequate granular data to split conventional industry groupings and reclassify them for digital products and digital industries. We therefore estimate the GVA 11 Nicholson, J.

In the absence of clear information on the share being sold through digital intermediaries, a small share of online sales might be double counted with the inclusion of the augmented digital GVA. for OECD 1-7, o ne of the high priorit y indicator s for measuring the digital economy. Our estimates are based on a triangulation of data from multiple sources, including data published by the NAD of MoSPI, the MCA database, CMIE Prowess, Tracxn, Employees Provident Fund Organisations Establishment Search portal, PLFS, ASI, and various market studies, industry reports, and company annual reports. Non-digital industries are outside the scope of the OECD approach. Given the digital disruptions in several traditional industries, we recommend the OECD augmented model to capture the digitalisation of firms within traditional industries that are also selling digitally but are not included in the OECD 1 -7 classification. We used primary surveys and focus group discussions to estimate the trends for three sectorstrade, BFSI, and educa tionand add their estimated digital output to the overall estimate, excluding any duplication. Scope of Measurement There is no single source of data for estima ting all seven OECD digital industries. The different data sources and assumptions used to estimate the GVA of OECD 1 -7 are discussed below. OECD 1: Digitally Enabling Industry (DEI). This industry is similar in scope to the ADBs definition of the core digital economy, which includes computer-related services, telecommunication services, manufacture of ICT goods (computers, communication equipment, etc.), and trade and repair of ICT goods. Given the increasingly digital nature of services involved in motion pictures, video and television programme production, 20  and broadcasting activities, these factors have also been added to the scope of the digitally enabling industry (see Table 2). These sub-sectors have also been included in the BEAs estimate for the size of the USs digital economy (see Appendix 4 for a comparison of the scope of the digitally enabling industry as defi ned by different countries). The estimation of the digitally enabling industry is entirely based on estimates from the NAS, provided by MoSPI in their 2024 report. The data pertains to the year 2022-23. Table 2: Unpacking the digital ly enabling industry (DEI) into identifiable industries and sub-industries with relevant NIC codes OECD 1: Digitally Enabling Industry (DEI)Industry Category NIC Code Manufacture of electronic component, consumer electronics, magnetic and optical media261,264,268 Manufacture of computer and peripheral equipment 262 Manufacture of communication equipment 263 Telecommunication 61 - 61103 Information and computer related services 62, 63 Wholesale trade and repair of computers 9511, 9512, 4651, 4652 Cable operators, broadcasters, recording and publishing 61103, 59, 60 OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7: Digital Intermediaries and Platforms. Firms within OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 cut across different industries according to the existing national accounts classification. For example, Amazon and Spinny while classified by NAS under wholesale and retail trade, by OECD definitions, they are classified as digital intermediary platforms charging a fee (OECD 2). Other digital intermediary platforms have been included under information and communication, administrative and support service categories, etc., implying that a sectoral approach of estimation or directly attributing values from NAS, for these digital industries will not work. We therefore compiled a database of domestic and non-domestic digital platforms using Tracxns company database. We filtered companies that were either categorised as consumer digital and selected those with a revenue of USD 50 million and above in 2022-23. The threshold, observably, included most companies that Source: ICRIER had any meaningful market share. However, for some upcoming companies, or those that were smaller in size, but considerably popular were also added, irrespective of their revenue. The final usable list of companies included 253 digital intermediaries and platforms. See Appendix 5 for the list of intermediaries used in our estimation and classification into OECD digital industries. It is important to note that some of the firms in this list were already a part of the corporate GVA for the digitally enabling industry (DEI or OECD 1). To avoid any double counting, we have removed the GVA of these select companies from the total of the DEI. Finally, the revenue figures for these companies have been converted to GVA values for aggregation- the ratios used are as per those in the NAS. For companies where revenue of 2022-23 has not been filed with the MCA, we extrapolate values using past year growth rates. See Figure 2 for steps followed for estimating the value of OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7.  21OECD 4: Firms and Individuals Dependent on Digital Intermediary Platforms. This category includes incomes and profits of a variety of stakeholders, such as MSME manufacturers and service providers, home-based entrepreneurs, gig workers such as delivery partners, content creators, and online influencers. As expected, there is no single source of credible data from which this category can be measured. Therefore, we used a combination of approaches. For the income of firms and individuals selling on intermediary platforms, we used estimates of GMV, subtracted the margin charged by platforms, and assumed a share of profit from the residual. 18 The share of profit for MSMEs was determined through survey-based research studies.19 For the income of gig workers on shared mobility Compiled a database of domestic and non-domestic digital platforms with defined thresholds (Source: Tracxn)Identified and verified the relevant NIC code of these firms (Source: MCA, MoSPI) Reclassified firms into the OECD digital industries (Source: ICRIER)Removed duplication if firm already existed in the sectors included in DEI, and adjusted for GVA (Source: ICRIER) Source: ICRIER MethodologyFigure 2: Steps in Estimation for OECD 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 Industries platforms, we only subtracted the commission paid by driver partners to the platform. The net income, after subtracting for costs such as vehicle maintenance and fuel, could not be estimated. Therefore, this is an upper limit for gig workers income. For content creators and influencers, we used a lower bound estimate, including only the reported income of YouTubers. 20 All assumptions and sources of data are provided in Appendix 6. OECD Augmented. Finally, we extended the OECD estimation to include the digital share of a few traditional industries: retail and wholesale trade, banking, BFSI, and education, which are industries that have experienced high levels of digitalisation and 18 Annual Survey of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India, ICRIER 2023 https://icrier.org/publications/annual-survey-of-micro-small-and-medium- enterprises-msmes-in-india-leveraging-e-commerce-for-the-growth-of-msmes/ 19 https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/youtube-india-ishan-john-chatterjee-fanfest-creator-economy-content-creators-17904491.htm 20 Ranipeta, S.

This was indeed a first-of-its-kind survey for the industry, which has not compiled any data, statutory or internal, to estimate the share of the digital economy. The survey was conducted in partnership with the CII and supported by MeitY, especially for data from the banking sector. The sample was restricted to the corporate sector and comprised the top 10-30 companies in each industry, especially those in which digitalisation was most likely. The data sought was for the year 2023-24 and focused mainly on revenue that was digitally generated and employment that was driving the digital aspects of the business. Questionnaires had to be customised for some sectors to reflect the differences in business models, types of transactions, and sources of revenue. Copies of the questionnaires and the estimated digital share for each sector are provided in Appendix 7. Data was collected Augmented OECD approach Figure 3: Measurement frameworks for Indias digital economy using global approaches Source: ICRIER Note: The original OECD framework does not require separate estimates for box IV and V, as their estimates are captured through the digital SUTs.

Rest of the traditional sectors selling online from March to May 2024. The survey estimates were used to extrapolate only for the corporate share of GVA for the sector. The scope of estimation for this study is summarised in Figure 3. The ADB estimates are provided separately and largely overlap with the OECDs digitally enabling industry. Aggregating the rest of the OECD industries provides an estimate of the overall digital economy. The OECD augmented approach captures the digital share for a few traditional sectors over and above the OECD digital industries but is currently limited to three sectors of the economy. Figure 3 indicates why determining a point estimate of the size of the digital economy is neither easy nor desirable. The scope between digital and non- digital is shifting every day, and depending on where one decides to draw the line, the point estimate could vary considerably. Thus, even the OECD augmented estimates presented here can be criticised for not capturing the entire digital economy as it excludes the digital output of several traditional sectors such as health, logistics and transport, and public administration (see Box V in Figure 3). 21 Calvino, F., Criscuolo, C., Marcolin, L.,  Squicciarini, M.

The share of OECD 1 or the digitally enabling industry (DEI), which is also defined as the core of the digital economy, in national GVA is found to be 7.83 per cent. The new digital industries, which include big techs, other digital platforms and intermediaries as well as firms dependent on digital intermediaries (OECD 2-7), account for nearly 2 per cent of GVA. As expected, firms dependent on digital intermediaries (OECD 4) have a higher output Output and Employment Estimates 22 GVA 2022- 23 is INR 246.59 lakh crore and GDP 2022-23 is INR 269.5 lakh crore https://iced.niti.gov.in/economy-and-demography/key-economic-indicators/gva USD estimate using 2022 average exchange rate of 78.598 from https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/yearly-average-currency-exchange-rates7.83% 0.41%0.05%0.69%0.10%0.18%0.31%0.20%9.76%0.48%1.21% 0.28% 11.74%Digitally Enabling Industry (adjusted) Digital intermediaries charging a fee Data and adverti sing driven digital intermediaries Firms dependent on digital intermediaries E tailers Digital only ﬁrms providing ﬁn.  insurance services Other producers operating digitally E - seller Digital Economy (OECD comparable) Trade (oﬄine ﬁrms selling online) BFSI (oﬄine ﬁrms selling online) Education (oﬄine ﬁrms selling online) Digital Economy (OECD augmented)Figure 4: GVA of Indias Digital Economy, 2022-23than the intermediaries themselves (OECD 2 and 3), reflecting the multiplier effect of the latter. Also, the combined contribution of the three traditional industries (BFSI, trade and education) to national output is around 2 per cent, rivaling in importance to the new digital industries. This is a clear indication of the digital economy moving outside the realm of big tech and digital platforms to digitalization in the rest of economy. Going forward the increasing share of the digital economy in GVA is likely to come from traditional industries adopting digital tools and practices. Among all sectors, the BFSI sector seems to be the most digitized, with nearly 20 per cent of the sectoral output coming from the digital side (see Sector Highlights for more details). Source: ICRIER Estimates Note: E-sellers, an extension of the e-tailer segment is reported separately in case one would want to exclude its value for estimation of the pure OECD framework 24  the digital economy are firms dependent on digital intermediaries and digital intermediary platforms, accounting for 5.9 per cent and 3.5 per cent of the digital sectors GVA. In the augmented segment, while banking and financial sector contribute 10.3 per cent of the digital economys GVA, retail trade and education contribute 4.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively (see Appendix 8 for estimation for the Augmented sectors).The corollary is to see the share of these components in the overall digital industry. The digitally enabling industry, which also includes some of the high growth sectors of the economy such as cloud computing services and some global capability centres, is the largest contributor to the GVA of the digital economy (see Box 2). It accounts for 67 per cent of the digital economy GVA (see Table 3). As per our estimates the other highest contributors to the OECD definition of SectorsGVA (Rs.

Table 3: GVA Estimates for the Digital Economy, 2022-23  25 The digital economys share in national income has seen a consistent rise over time. We present the trajectory using a combination of estimates provided by previous studies, our estimates from the ADB approach (which use a more disaggregated input-output table (66 X 66 industries) than those used by ADB), and the OECD approach. 23 The size of the digital economy was estimated to be 11.74% in 2022-23 (see Figure 5). Although the comparison is between two different approaches of measurement that define the scope differently, a comparison of ADB estimates over time would also indicate an increase. Since the OECD 23 Refer to Appendix 2 for details on the ADB approachapproach delves into the changing nature of digital business models and their contribution to the GVA, in addition to the role of the digitally enabling industry, the approach would be better suited for estimating the digital economy. There is, however, scope to improve and adapt the OECD approach to capture important digital industries. A flexible approach will allow the OECD approach to capture the changing nature of digital businesses as well as capture the digitalised components of traditional businesses. We have used the OECD augmented approach to reflect the latter f actor. Box 2: Some of the Faster Growing Segments of the Digital Economy Cloud Market: Indias cloud market (public) accounted for 1. 1-1.2% of the global market in 2020-23 and is estimated to have grown at a CAGR of 29% to reach USD 8.3 billion. With businesses increasingly adopting AI for streamlining operations, enhancing productivity, improving customer experience, and launching new services, the cloud market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24% over the 2024-27 period to reach USD 20.3 billion by the end of 202 7. In the NAS, cloud services are recoded under computer-related services (OECD 1). Computer-related services also happens to be the fastest growing sub-sector for the digitally enabling industry. Between 2011-12 and 2022-23, the CAGR of this sector is 16.2%, compared to 15.6% for the manufacture of communication equipment and 10% for both the manufacture of computer and peripheral equipment and telecommunication services. GCCs: GCCs are offshore centres established by multinational corpora tions to provide a variety of services to their parent organisations, including RD, IT support, and business process management. India has also become an international leader for GCCs, home to almost 55% of the worlds GCCs in 2022. The number of operational GCCs in India has been on the rise, from 1250 in 2017 -19, to 1580 in 2020-22, and predicted to rise to 1900 in 2023-25. Among 22 of the top GCCs in India, nine are classified within the ICT sector, specifically computer-related services. In 2022-23, the revenue of these companies stood at around 3.1% of the total output of DEI and 6% of total output of computer-related services. Indias growth in computer-related activities has been consistently strong, with more opportunities on the horizon in this sub-sector.

The former refers to overall sale, while the latter is gross value added. 26  Digitalisation of traditional sectors The primary survey and stakeholder discussions highlighted interesting facts about how different sectors are digitalising and their contribution to the revenue generated by firms. Not all aspects of businesses are digitalising uniformly. For example, retail sales are digitalising much more than wholesale sales. Firms are also investing in digital methods for customer acquisition and business development. Chatbots and AI applications are fairly commonplace. Sector-specific highlights are summarised below. BFSI. In the BFSI sector, the highest level of digitalisation has occurred in the payments segment of banks. On average, over 95% of payment transactions for public and private sector banks are now digital. Other transaction categories, such as loan applications and investments, are relatively less digitalised. While the digital share of transactions for banks is observed to be very high, the digital share of revenue is low, as some of the highest revenue-generating activities are Figure 5: Estimates for Size of Indias Digital Economy 2014-15 to 2022-23 Source: Compiled by ICRIER largely offline. Other financial services institutions are relatively less digitalised than banks. Retail. For the retail sector, most companies are opting for an omni-channel model, of which digital is a steadily growing part. In fact, many companies are developing their own platforms in addition to selling on intermediary platforms. An interesting trend is that e-tailers and e-sellers such as Nykaa, Urban Ladder, FirstCry that began as completely online models have, over time, invested in physical stores. While the share of online selling is growing, offline formats will continue to exist and grow for some companies. Additionally, while the use of AI chatbots is becoming very common among retail companies at the customer end, internal processes are being optimised through the use of digital inventory-management tools. Education. Among educational institutions, there are three clear formats exist: complete offline, hybrid, and complete online. Most large institutions use a Note: RBI (2022) refers to the following study conducted by RBI researchers: Gajbhiye, D., Arora, R., Nahar, A., Yangdol, R.,  Thakur, I. (2022, December).

As is the case with retail, some edutech firms such as Physics Wallah have transitioned from a completely online to a hybrid model. Hospitality and logistics. Hotels are digitalising several aspects of their business, including supply chain, vendor management, customer experience, and sales. On the sales side, by investing in new technologies like metaverse and AI, hotels are creating virtual experiences for potential customers, which are near-perfect substitutes for physical visits. Most interviews suggest that digital sales for their sector are likely to increase by 10-25% in the next five years. Most large logistics companies have completely digitalised the tracking of shipped goods. Pick-ups and delivery are also coordinated digitally. However, smaller courier and shipping companies and those operating in the informal sector are only partially digitalised. Projections: The future is bright Digital economy will account for nearly one-fifth of the economy by 2030 Indias digital economy is expected to grow almost twice as fast as the overall economy, accounting for nearly 20% of the GVA by 2030. This includes the digital economy defined by OECD as well as the digital share of three sectors identified as digitally disrupted. If we only consider the OECD definition, then the digital econ omy is estimated to be 16.5% of the total economy in 2030 (see Figure 6a). The projections are based on four assumptions: (i) the decadal rate of growth of the DEI enabling industry, data for which is available in the national accounts; (ii) the rate of growth of revenue for digital businesses and platforms for the last two y ears; (iii) the rate of growth of the traditional industries inc luded in the augmented analysis; and (iv) the expe cted rate of digitalisation for these traditional industries. As ex pected, the digital economy has been growing much faster than the rest of the economy. While the overall economy, measured in nominal GVA, was growing at a rate of 11.8% over the last 10 years, the sectors comprising the digital-enabling industry were growing at 1 7.3%. Digital platforms and intermediaries are growing much faster (30%) and are likely to do so for the next few years. Consequently, the gains to businesses and individual entrepreneurs are also going to be higher. The diverging trends between the DEI enabling industry and the OECD estimate of the entire digital economy, and between the OECD and OECD augmented estimates, suggest that the share of Indias digital economy is expected to increase not only from the growth of the DEI enabling industries but its wider diffusion in the rest of the economy. For all assumptions and calculations, see Appendix 9.

Based on these assumptions, the digital economy is expected to surpass USD 1 trillion by 2029. Contribution to Employment Digital economy employs nearly 2.5% of the workforce In 2022-23, the digital economy accounted for 14.67 million workers, or 2.55% of Indias workforce. The estimation is b ased on the same definition and scope as that for the digital economy GVA. The data has also been triangulated from different sources, as was the case for GVA. See Figure 7 for a disaggregation of the employment estimates, which shows that the highest share of employment is in the DEI enabling industry (58.07%), corresponding to the digital GVA shares. Men constitute about 78% of the employment in the DEI enabling industry; however, the services sub- sectors show a slightly lower gender gap (75% male). The gender split for the rest of the components is not available. While core activities involving the production of digital technologies or services may still be dominated b y men, such as in coding and programming activities and STEM-related occupations, the digitalisation process itself has been associated with increased female employment.25 Not only do digital platforms create new job opportunities for women, the digitalisation of  29traditional sectors also create options for women that were hitherto unavailable due to mobility restrictions and safety concerns. Finally, as suggested above, while the platform economy has the potential to be gender inclusive in its employment creation (such as professional 25 C anavire-Bacarreza, Y. Y. G.

However, the NASSCOM estimate is not directly comparable with ours because the scope of DEI is broader and the NIC industries included in the two estimates are also different. NITI Aayogs Gig Economy report estimated that, in 2020-21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig economy (2.6% of the non-agricultural workforce or 1.5% of the total workforce). They used data from the NSS Employment Unemployment Survey and the PLFS to estimate the number of individuals employed in the gig economy (non-agricultural sectors) by using broader filters. The first level of filtering uses data for individuals between 18 and 45 years in the top 100 cities, with education from secondary school to graduation, and household consumption expenditure below the 75th percentile of monthly per-capita consumption expenditure. This estimate was then narrowed down to occupations that can be part of the gig economy and industries with large concentrations of gig work. Finally, the share of workers with a mobile phone and bank account were applied based on World Bank estimates to arrive at an estimate of employment in the platform gig economy. Other estimates for gig work include Fairworks 2020 report that estimated that about 30.3 lakh (3.03 million) individuals were employed by eleven large platforms as gig workers. Our estimates of gig workers and content creators, which is part of OECD 4 industry, is 45.2 lakhs in 2022- 23which is between the NITI Aayog and Fairwork estimates. Our estimates are likely to be lower than the actual numbers because they include gig workers in only 75% of total platform and intermediaries, which were the only ones for which reliable data was available. 30  The structure of employment for the digital economy appears to be bimodal, with over 37% comprising platform gig workers, content creators, and digital sales in MSMEs (OECD 4) and the rest accounting for a mix of manufacturing workers, managers, engineers, For the OECD augmented section, employment estimates are considerably lower than their GVA estimates, constituting only 1.06% of the overall estimate of employment in the digital economy, compared to 16.8% in the share of digital GVA. This estimation is based on the primary survey. In general, 29 Estimates of percentage of employment that is attributable to the digital economy for the three sectors is calculated as average over the firms surveyed, weighted by their revenue. The survey defined digital employment as those engaged in the following digital activities: IT management, software management, computer management, web publishing, digital media marketing, data analytics, telecommunications, and telemarketing. These sector-wise estimates of percentage attributable to digital were then applied to estimates of the number of individuals employed in the private sector (public/private limited companies), which were calculated based on percentages from the PLFS applied to an estimated total employment of 575,540,000 based on MoHFW projections.Source: ICRIER estimates58.07%0.71%0.14%37.76%0.89%0.69%0.36%0.33%98.94%0.54%0.50%0.02% 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14Digital ly Enabling IndustryDigital intermediary platforms charging a feeData and advertising driven digital platformsFirms dependent on digital intermediariesE tailersDigital only ﬁrms providing ﬁnancial  insurance servicesOther producers operating digitallyE - sellerDigital Economy (OECD Comparable)TradeFinancial ServicesEducationDigital Economy (OECD Augmented) Number employed (millions)Breakdown of Employment in the Digital Economy % of employment in the digital economy14.51 million14.67 million 5.54 million 8.52 millionFigure 7: Breakdown of Employment in the Digital Economyand other professionals. In its current form, the former group tends to be more precarious and lower paid, while the latter group tends to be characterised by salaried jobs with higher pay levels and better working conditions. besides the IT department, firms have limited jobs that are dedicatedly digital. Resources that serve digital sales or digital content usually perform other roles as well. See Appendix 10 for detailed calculations of the employment estimate. 29  31 30 Total GVA for trade and repair services was INR 2615146 crore in 2022-23. The corresponding employment number for retail and wholesale trade estimated from PLFS is 58.7 million (10.2% of total UPSS employment). 31 These are rough estimates for labour productivity, as the composition of labour unit across sectors is not uniformly defined. The employment numbers include both full-time and part-time workers are also based on assumptions. 32 Estimates for GVA of 4651 and 4652, and 9511 and 9512 will be partitioned from aggregate values as available in the NAS.Accordingly, the labour productivity calculated for the digital share of these traditional sectors is higher than for the rest of the sector. For example, in the retail and trade sector, the estimated labour productivity based on reported statistics from NAS and PLFS is approximately INR 4.5 lakhs per unit of labour for the overall sector, while that for the digital share is INR 1.5 crore. 30 In general, we find that labour productivity Box 4: Our Estimates are Likely to be Conservative and Downward Biased While our estimates go beyond the OECD framework to include digitalisation in traditional sectors, not all components of the OECD framework have been adequately represented in our estimation. This is largely due to challenges of data availability and usability. Sectors under the digitally enabling industry (OECD 1) are well aligned to the national industry classification and therefore adequately captured. However, minor discrepancies may exist when differentiating between the GVA of industries that are often grouped together, such as ICT trade, repair of communication equipment, and computers  peripheral equipment, for which disaggregated values are not available. There is no comprehensive list available for digital platforms covered under OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.For this data, we relied on our own compiled list of companies categorised as consumer digital companies, most of which have a revenue of USD 50 million (INR 400 crores equivalent) and above, thereby excluding several small and medium- sized start-ups. Even for this list, data for all companies wa s not available. The employment estimates are also based on this list. Estimates for GVA as well as em ployment for OECD 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are therefore underestimated.for the digital economy is five times greater than the rest of the economy, highest for digital intermediaries and platforms, followed by the digitally enabling industry, and lowest for firms benefitting from digital intermediaries. The labour productivity of firms dependent on intermediaries is similar to that of the overall economy.31 32  This report is an attempt to put together the first set of credible, comprehensible and current estimates on Indias digital economy. The limitations of this report are largely a result of the data gaps that make assessment of a dynamic phenomenon like the digital economy very challenging. The data gaps can be divided into two main categories: (i) data that exists but has not been compiled or matched and (ii) data that does not exist. In the first category, the following require attention: The way NIC codes are assigned to companies is not uniform across different agencies (e.g., MCA and MoSPI). This makes the matching and compilationof data from different sources challenging.  The assignment of companies to industries in the NAS is not public information. In the absenceof knowledge of how companies are assignedparticularly those that are largely digital or areregistered as IT companies but create value inother sectors like retail, education, transportation,or finance (i.e., their parent industry)can resultin the aggregation of GVA at the sectoral levelbeing inaccurate. A uniform principle for theirclassification going forward would be important.  A un iversal database of digital intermediaries and platforms is not available. Data when compiled fromdifferent market research databases, MCA, EPFO,or a web search, cannot be verified. Importantcompanies may also be left out in the filteringprocess.  Lac k of public data on disaggregates affects the accuracy of the estimation. Availability of sectordisaggregates helps distinguish between the digitaland non-digital components of a sector, which areotherwise grouped together in national accounts.For example, publishing includes web and softwarepublishing as well as the publishing of books andprinted material.Data Gaps in the Measurement of the Digital Economy In the second category, the gaps are as follows: Lac k of updated input-output table IOTs and SUTs that capture digitalisation-led structural changes in the economy Lac k of enterprise surveys (both for manufacturing and services) that can estimate the numberand share of firms receiving orders digitally anddelivering digitally. These surveys will help builddigital SUTs from national SUTs.  Lac k of data on gig workers, including home-based entrepreneurs, delivery partners, contractualdrivers, influencers, content creators, andfreelancers Recommendations for measuring the size of Indias digital economy The recommendations are developed from the data gaps and limitations identified in this report. While recommendations have been categorised into four distinct categories, they are interdependent and flow into each other.  Nar row the data gap Exp and the enterprise surveysfor both manufacturing and servicesto include questions on digitalisation and the use ofdigital technologies, including questions ondigital exports and imports. These surveys willhelp build digital SUTs from conventional SUTs.Some sample questions from the enterprisesurvey of the UK, Netherlands, and the US areprovided in Appendix 11.

It is equally important torecognise the efforts of digitalisation intraditional industries, which may currentlybe small but are will expand significantly overtime. In this report, this approach has beenpresented as OECD augmented for the trade,BFSI and, education sectors.  Mo ve beyond the estimation of size to measure impact Me itY should consider undertaking a separate study on estimating the productivity gains from digitalisation that help ascertain supply-side efficiencies, especially for manufacturingsectors that do not necessarily order anddeliver digitally. The analysis will complementestimates presented in this report that definedigital industries based on a narrow set ofcharacteristics for firms.  Th e Ministry of Labour  Employment should consider undertaking a study to understandthe impacts on employment and labourmarkets, especially from the gender lens. It isimportant to study the impact of digitalisationon different occupations and the net effect onemployment in different sectors. 34  Following from our analysis and measurement of Indias digital economy, there can be three levers that contribute to the size of Indias digital economy: (i) the DEI enabling industry, which broadly comprises IT services, manufacture of electronic components, and com puters; (ii) digital platforms and intermediaries; an d (iii) traditional non-digital sectors of the economy, which are also digitalising rapidly. Digitalisation of the Recommendations for Accelerating the Pace of Digitalisation in India 33 MeitY. (2022). Promotion of digital literacy. https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID1885958 34 NSSO. (2023). Multiple indicator survey in India  202-2021. NSS Report No. 589. https://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Multipl eIndicatorSurveyinIndiaf.pdfeconomy can be accelerated through each of these levers. When it comes to policies, we group them into five categories, as shown in Table 4. Each policy pillar can apply to one or more than one lever. For instance, digital literacy and skilling is applicable to all levers while ensuring regulatory certainty seems most pressing for digital platforms and intermediaries. Table 4: Policy recommendations to accelerate the pace of digitalisation in India LeverPolicyßDigital Literacy and SkillingRegulatory CertaintyCyber Security  TrustEase of Doing BusinessDigital Infrastructure Digitally Enabling Industry   Digital Platforms and Intermediaries     Traditionally non-digital sectors    Adopt collaborative and concerted efforts for digital literacy and skilling Digital literacy has been at the centre of government policies to promote digitalisation. The Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan (DISHA) or National Digital Literacy Mission was formulated in 2017 to provide IT training to 52.5 lakh people. Subsequently, the government introduced the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan (PMGDISHA) with a target train six crore individuals, including Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers. 3 3 Although both programmes have concluded, survey results reflect that the country lags behind in digital literacy. According to the NSSOs Multiple Indicator Survey published in 2023, 70% of Indian youth aged between 15 and 29 years cannot send emails with files attached, and nearly 60% cannot copy and move a file or folder. 34 In the absence of these basic digital skills, citizens will find it challenging to benefit from the digitalisation of government services. Moreover, employability is a huge challenge. The gains of digitalisation will reflect when citizens and businesses are able to use available digital tools at scale. Accordingly, we recommend the following:  Encour age improvement in outcomes of basic education and literacy in primary and secondary schools as a prerequisite for strengthening digitalliteracy, and incorporate digital literacy in the K-12programme in schools  Make co ncerted efforts towards reducing adult illiteracy and skilling that necessitates improvedcoordination between different government  35departments, greater involvement of the private sector, and increased use of technology-aided programmes  Imp lement well-designed and curated programmes that help improve employability Inc orporate the use of edge technologies like AI and robotics Minimise regulatory uncertainty for digital platforms and intermediaries The rapid scaling of digital platforms and new digital businesses have also raised alarm bells on the risks of misselling, the misuse of personal data, misinformation, and monopolisation, among others. Regulators and policymakers have responded with a series of new regulations addressing the risks from new digital businesses. Many regulations are either under consultation, in draft stage, or have rules pending. Most regulations see at least a few shifts. Until finalised, businesses, especially new businesses, would find it challenging to navigate uncertainty. We recommend the following:  Con duct transparent and timely consultations Coo rdinate with all involved government bodies to ensure regulatory alignment Min imise time between the announcement of intent and passing of law Bri ng regulatory clarity on the use of emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies, gaming, and generative AI, and removing frictions in theoperation of digital platforms Enhance cybersecurity and trust Cyberattacks and cybercrimes are the weakest link of in rapidly digitalising economiesin India as well as most countries in the world. Some sectors, such as health, banking, and government institutions, are more susceptible to attacks than others. Accelerating digitalisation requires building resilience and trust. We recommend the following: Inc entivise businesses to invest in cybersecurity systems Inc rease cybersecurity awareness, making it a key component of digital skilling programmes Bui ld cross-country collaboration for the identification and mitigation of cybercrimes Str engthen cybersecurity response teams Invest in RD to build stronger and more secure ITnetworks Improve the ease of doing business Government policies and fiscal incen tives, such as for IT services, mobile phones, and telecommunications, h ave helped the Indian industry grow. However, the push is not adequate to create the acceleration that the digitally enabling industry requires to produce resilient, indigenous products both for domestic needs and for exports. The off-take on semiconductors is slow, value addition in mobile phones is low, telecom is yet to unleash competitive forces, and representation in standard-setting is limited. In light of this, we recommend the following: Enhance coordination among key government departments, such as the Department ofCommerce, MeitY, and Department of Telecom, toprovide comprehensive policies and targeted fiscalschemes that help reduce cost disabilities  Invest in high-quality physical infrastructure, suchas logistics and energy resources, that lower thecost of doing business  Improve Centre-State coordination, and providefriendly terms to investors, both foreign anddomestic  Review and re-evaluate business laws, includinglabour laws (e.g., extending work hours in ICTsector, providing adequate safeguards for workers,etc.) to create a balance between labour rights andcompliance cost 36  Make high-quality broadband universal Indias digital ambition relies on access to high-quality and universal broadband. The coverage and quality of infrastructure has increased by leaps and bounds, but the journey is far from complete. The increase is data consumption has proven that existing bandwidth levels are grossly inadequate, leading to challenges such as call drops. Additionally, besides urban blind spots, several rural government schools and hospitals are not connected to the internet. Access to broadband infrastructure will not only help expand the footprint of digital businesses but also enable traditional businesses to offer their services digitally. We recommend the following: M ake continued efforts towards building resilient fixed-line broadband networks to supplementmobile coverage  I ncentivise the private sector to invest in quality upgrades through appropriate policy interventions Co mbine supply-side efforts with demand-side interventions to ensure the affordability of devicesand data services  37Table A1: Cross-Country Review of Methodologies (other than OECD approach) Author, Year of PublishingCountry Estimate Year Estimation approach Other details RBI, 2022India 8.5% of GVA 2019 Uses satellite accounts based on national SUTs and IOTs.

Estimates are not directly comparable due to the scope of coverageAuthor, Year of PublishingCountry Estimate Year Estimation approach Other details  41Our estimation based on the ADB approach relies on the SUT published by the Ministry of Statistics and Program Our estimation based on the ADB approach relies on the SUTs published by MoSPI as the starting point. This appendix provides details about how this was conducted. The SUTs depict the structure of an economy by showing linkages between how products are produced and used by an industry. The latest available SUT for India is for 2019-20. These SUTs are transformed into IOTs, an industry-to-industry matrix that provides inter-industry linkages. Industries in the IOT can be classified into fully digital, partially digital, or non-digital. For partially digital industries, only the relevant shares are included in the estimation. The existing estimate for Indias digital economy is based on ADBs annually published 35 industry by 35 industry (35 x 35) national IOT.36 According to their analysis, Indias digital economy was estimated at 8.5% of GVA in 2019-20. The IOT used for this analysis is based on the World Input Output Database (WIOD), which relies on MoSPIs 2014-15 SUT. While it has been updated by ADB to reflect aggregate changes in the economy for 2019-20, the underlying production structure of the economy continues to reflect that of 2014-15. In other words, massive digitalisation since the launch of the Digital India programme and further acceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not captured in their estimates. Digital shifts for industries such as financial services, including the scaling of digital payments, direct benefit transfer, retail through e-commerce, and education through e-learning services, which lead to higher productivity and output are therefore not fully reflected in these estimates. 36 Gajbhiye, D., Arora, R., Nahar, A., Yangdol, R.,  Thakur, I. (2022, December). Measuring Indias digital economy. RBI Bulletin. https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/ Bulletin/PDFs/05ART201220221265B8E871824B98970F03E87228C0FE.PDF 37 We follow the model B transformation approach conducted under the industry technology assumption, which states that each industry has its own specific way of production, irrespective of its product mix. More details on the transformation are provided later.In addition to providing comparable and updated estimates using the ADBs 35 x 35 IOT for 2022, this study builds upon previous work in two ways:  Provides more updated data, reflecting a more updated structure of the economy by using the latest SUT of 2019-20, which was not available for previous studies  Provides more disaggregated data, transforming the SUTs into corresponding IOTs that are more disaggregated than the ones used in previous studies, allowing for more granular partitioning of industries into digital and non-digital, thus providing more accurate estimates. Our final estimates are based on this IOT. This study uses the latest 2019-20 SUT from MoSPI, and transforms it into a 66 industry x 66 industry IOT using ADBs methodology37. Unlike the 35 industry X 35 industry IOT, there are fewer partially digital sectors. This reduces the assumptions in the model and serves as a more accurate representation of the core digital economy. The core of the digital economy is defined as products or industries belonging to 5 groups: hardware, software publishing, web publishing, telecommunication services, and specialized  support services. Table A3 below provides the list of industries that fall within this definition as per the ISIC classification and matches them to the industry categories for the two IOTs.Appendix 2: Details of the ADB approach adopted to estimate Indias core digital economy 42  38 The 2019-20 IOT has discrepancies between output-side and expenditure-side aggregates, consistent with the discrepancies reported in NAS. These have been addressed to arrive at a balanced matrix. Discrepancies in the IOTs of subsequent year have also been addressed similarly.Table A3: Scope of Core Digital Industries Core digital industries ADBs 35 X 35 IOT Indias 66 X 66 IOT Main Activity Group Code Industry Industry Industry Hardware2620Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment Electrical and Optical Equipment (P)Manufacturing of computer and peripheral equipment 2680Manufacture of magnetic and optical mediaManufacturing of electronic component, consumer electronics, magnetic and optical media (P) Telecommunications services61Telecommunications servicesPost and Telecommunication (P)Communications (P) Specialized and support services62Computer programming services, consulting, and other related services Renting of Machinery and Equipment and Other Business Activities (P)Computer-related services 6311Data processing, hosting, and related activities Web publishing 6312 Web portals Software publishing 5820 Software publishing Source: ADB (2021); Authors calculations. Sectors marked with (P) are partitioned to include only digital components, while others are completely digital. Manufacturing of computer and peripheral equipment and Computer related services are treated as fully digital sectors in the 66 x 66 IOT. The partially digital sectors are identified as Communications and Manufacturing of electronic components, consumer electronics, magnetic and optical media. In line with ADBs definition, the digital component of the core digital industry, Telecommunications, is partitioned from the broader Communications industry by using its share in GVA from NAS. The digital component of Manufacturing of electronic components in Manufacturing of magnetic and optical media is partitioned using the 2019-20 ASI. After partitioning the IOT into clean digital and non-digital industries, we use the Leontief inverse to arrive at new estimates for the digital economy for 2019-20. To estimate the shares for 2020-21 and 2021-22, we extrapolate the 2019-20 IOT using corresponding financial year aggregates from NAS.38 The approach followed for future projections is discussed in Section 4 of this paper. Below is a comparison of the estimates, data, and assumptions.  43Table A4: Comparison of Estimation Based on ADB Approach ICRIER Estimate Based on Disaggregated IOTICRIER Estimate Based on Aggregated IOTGajbhiye et al.

The IOT is based on basic-price use table, while the reported use table is at the purchasers price. To arrive at the basic-price use table from a purchasers price use table, we adjust the product-by-industry use by subtracting from it the product-by-industry values for product taxes less subsidies and import duty (referred to as taxes in this section) and imports and trade  transport margins. While columns are often referred to as industries in this section, the same adjustments will be extended to the final consumption columns (PFCE, GFCE, GFCF, CIS, valuables, and exports). Taxes, trade  transport margins, and imports are reported as aggregate columns for each product; therefore, they need to be redistributed into a product x industry matrix. This redistribution occurs based on the share of use of product i by industry j in total use of product i. In the redistributed trade  transport margins matrix, we deviate from using shares for redistribution for trade and transport products (trade, railway transport, land transport, air transport, water transport, and supportive and auxiliary transport activities). This exception arises as margins for these products are reported incomes, i.e., they are negative rather than positive. We multiply the negative margins by the share of margins paid by all other non-trade and non-transport products in industry j in the total margins paid by all other products. Thus, the income from margins for trade and transport products is distributed across industries based on the share of margins paid by the users of products in those industries. An adjustment to be noted in the supply table of the SUT prior to the redistribution exercise is in the treatment of product taxes less subsidies for trade. Even though trade does report taxes and avails subsidies, as reflected in the supply table, the expectation would be that these ultimately get passed on to consumers of trade. Therefore, we redistribute taxes less subsidies, as reported in the trade row, between products that report a positive trade and transport margin on the basis of their share in total positive trade and transport margins. To ensure that the table balances itself, the changes in the product taxes less subsidies column are accounted for within the trade and transport margins column. There are four transformation models that can be adopted to arrive at an IOT from an SUT: Model A (Product technology assumption), Model B (Industry technology assumption), Model C (Fixed industry sales structure assumption), and Model D (Fixed product sales structure assumption). Model A and model B assumptions result in a product-by-product IOT, and model C and model D result in industry-by-industry IOT (Eurostat, 2008). For the purposes of our study, we adopt the industry technology assumption of model B that each industry has its own specific way of production, irrespective of its product mix. This means that we assume that each industry has its own input structure, irrespective of its different types of products. Even if the ratios/number of products in its output mix changes, the proportions of inputs required to produce the output remains consistent with the initial input structure (Eurostat, 2008). Since model Bs transformation matrix gives a product- by-product IOT, we rework the transformation matrix such that it yields an industry-by-industry IOT when multiplied with the basic-price use table. The transformation matrix is a product-by-industry matrix where each element is the share of supply of the product by the industry in the total supply of the product in the economy. The transpose of this transformation matrix is multiplied with the intermediate consumption matrix and the final consumption matrix from the basic-price use table. This multiplication results in an industry-by-industry intermediate consumption matrix where each element is a convex combination of the supply of products produced by the industry described in the row with the use of products by the industry described in the column. Therefore, each element describes the proportion of products used by the industry column that are provided by the industry row. Similarly, each element in the derived final consumption matrix is a convex combination of the share of products produced by the industry row and the quantity of final consumption of these products. The final step is to  45add the row items of taxes, imports, gross output, and gross value added for each industry. We also conduct two simple checks to assess whether the IOT is internally consistent: the sum of intermediate consumption, imports, taxes, and gross value added should equal the gross output for each industry, and the total use should equal the total output. Calculation of estimates based on the IOT ADBs methodology is based on the standard input-output framework, which uses the Leontief Inverse to represent the economy as a distribution of GVA: where is an n x 1 matrix of output for n industries of the economy, is an n x n matrix of intermediate consumption and y is an n x 1 matrix of final demand for each industry. Constructing a matrix such that where is intermediate consumption of p roducts produced by industry i by industry j and is the output of industry j, then we get: Rearranging this equation, following the rules of matrix multiplication, gives us: Pre-multiplying this equation by where , we get an equation describing the entire economys GVA. If we diagonalise the and vectors to and , we get the matrix in which represents the value- added contribution of industry i in the final demand of industry j. Using the matrix, its possible to isolate the value-added contribution of the digital industries to itself (own linkages), to non-digital sectors (forward linkages) as well as the value-added contribution of non-digital industries to digital industries (backward linkages). Extrapolating the 2019-20 IOT for 2020-21 and 2021-22 and addressing discrepancies in the NAS Since there is no SUT available for years 2020-21 and 2021-22, we extrapolate the IOTs for these years based on the structure of the 2019-20 IOT and corresponding financial year aggregates from the NAS.Industry-wise GVA and output, taxes and import duties less subsidies, imports, and final expenditure (PFCE, GFCE, GFCF, CIS, valuables, and exports of goods  services) from NAS 2020-21 and 2021-22 are used to establish the row and column totals of the corresponding 2020-21 and 2021-22 IOTs. The structure of the 2019-20 IOT (i.e., the linkages between each industryi.e., from each row to column) is used to populate the values of the new IOT based on these updated aggregate values. Each industry is share in a given industry js total use from the 2019-20 IOT is applied to the 2020-21 total use of industry j (column sum) to obtain estimates for industry js use of industry i (each cell within that column). Similarly, each industry's share in total imports, total taxes, and import duties less subsidies and total expenditure are taken from the 2019-20 SUT and updated for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 SUTs based on aggregates obtained from NAS. Aggregates from NAS: Assumptions Due to a lack of complete data on FISIM per industry as well as disaggregation for all industries in the IOT, we make certain assumptions to determine the output, FISIM-adjusted inputs, and similarly adjusted GVA for 2020-21 and 2021-22 for the 66 industries in the IOT. These assumptions differ between sectors as we attempt to mirror the allocation present in SUT 2019-20. The rationale is to, at the very least, retain consistency in the absence of accurate published data on the allocation of FISIM. The assumptions are as follows:  Minin g and quarrying sector: The initial distribution of FISIM in 2019-20 as determined from the IOT is assumed to be consistent for the following periodsto maintain consistency in distribution. First, FISIMis determined based on the 2019-20 distributionfor the non-metallic minerals  minor minerals,fuel minerals, and metallic minerals sectors.These newly determined FISIM-adjusted inputs arethen divided based on the disaggregation presentin the IOT.  C rude petroleum and natural gas: We assume that their respective share in their total output remainsthe same across the three periods. This assumptionis made due to a lack of disaggregated data fornatural gas and petroleum separately. 46  M anufacturing: We assume that the distribution of FISIM as reported in the SUT remains the same across all manufacturing sub-sectors. While thereis a possibility that FISIM should be divided basedon GVA, for consistency, we maintain the initialshare of FISIM.  F inancial and insurance services: The share of output and input have been divided based onshares as reported in the SUT27% and 73% forinput and value added for the financial sector and40% and 60% for the insurance sector.  R eal estate, ownership of dwellings, and other professional services: We deviate fromassumptions made in previous sectors regardingthe distribution of FISIM and calculate its sharesbased on the share of unadjusted GVA of sectors.An aggregate number for FISIM is provided, whichis then multiplied by the share of the GVA of thatsub sector in the sector. Balancing Discrepancies - Assumptions Both the 2019-20 IOT and the IOT for subsequent years have discrepancies between output-side aggregates and expenditure-side aggregates, consistent with those reported in the NAS, that need to be addressed to have a balanced table. In 2019-20, the NAS reported a discrepancy of INR 113,925 crore between the production side and the expenditure side, i.e., the national accounts reported a higher value for the supply of products than the use of products. This discrepancy is accounted for in the 2019-20 SUT published by MoSPI, mainly through adjustments in imports, private final consumption expenditure, change in inventories, and exports. Similarly, NAS reported a discrepancy for 2020-21 and 2021-22, albeit a negative discrepancy, indicating a higher reported number for the expenditure side than the production side. For the 2020-21 IOT, the discrepancies between the output and total use per industry are smaller than the total expenditure for each industry. Therefore, these discrepancies are adjusted between industry-wise PFCE, CIS, and exports, in that order of preference. For the 2021-22 IOT, the discrepancies are adjusted similarly, except for three industries, whose discrepancies are considerably larger than the expenditure valuescoal  lignite, non-ferrous metal ores, and other mining. For these three sectors, discrepancies are adjusted in the imports of industries that report high intermediate consumption. For coal  lignite, the imports of electricity are adjusted. This adjustment has been made because the energy balance 39 of India shows that most imports of coal are consumed by this industry. For non-ferrous metal ores, imports of the manufacture of basic iron and steel  casting of iron and steel, manufacture of basic precious and non-ferrous metals  casting of non-ferrous metals, manufacture of electrical equipments, manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products, and other manufacturing industries are adjusted. While the domestic production of non-ferrous metal ores has increased, these increases are missing for downstream non-ferrous metallic ores. 40 For other mining, the industries for which imports are adjusted are manufacture of basic iron and steel  casting of iron and steel, manufacture of basic precious and non-ferrous metals  casting of non-ferrous metals, manufacture of electrical equipments, manufacture of chemical and chemical products except pharmaceuticals, medicinal and botanical products, manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products, other manufacturing, and construction. These industries have large import values and are also large intermediate consumers of products from other mining. The adjustments per industry appear to be 5% or less than corresponding import values. Storage and warehousing do not have final demand but does report a discrepancy between the supply and use side. For this reason, storage and warehouse discrepancies have been allocated to PFCE. It should be noted that the choice of this allocation is not as important to the final estimate determined in this study because it does not affect the final value, but any analysis that tries to isolate or examine these components should consider how these allocations are done. Allocations for adjustment follow ADBs standard practice for balancing IOTs. 39Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation. (2023, March).

Two important components that separate DIPs from other online platforms as well as from traditional retail and wholesale activity, are the charging of a fee for facilitating a transaction and the absence of economic ownership of the product or service by the business facilitating the transaction. DIPs do not include social media and platforms that provide services free of charge. Lyft, an example of a DIP, facilitates the transaction by acting as an agent and does not consider itself to take ownership of the services provided. 3Data and Advertising-Driven Digital PlatformsExamples include search engines, web mapping platforms, public transport applications, mobile wallets, information sharing (e.g., sport results) applications, social media, and social networking sites 4Firms Dependent on Intermediary PlatformsProducers dependent on digital intermediary platforms are units that sell most of their goods or services via intermediation platforms. These are largely workers or contractors that source work from digital labour platforms: Online web-based platforms, where tasks or work assignments are performed online or remotely by workers before being (digitally or physically) delivered to the client) or location-based platforms, where tasks or work assignments are carried out in person in specified physical locations by workers 5 E-Tailers Traders engaged in the purchasing and reselling goods who receive most of their orders digitally 6Digital-Only Firms Providing Financial and Insurance ServicesComprises financial service providers, including insurance, reinsurance, and pension schemes and funds, which operate predominantly online, with limited or no avenues to physically interact with consumers. Also includes financial platforms that facilitate digital P2P lending and crowdfunding. 7Other Producers Only Operating DigitallyComprises units operating exclusively online that are not included in one of the previous six digital industries. Includes businesses that produce their own goods and services and interact with consumers in an exclusively digital manner. All ordering within this industry would be considered as digitally ordered, and all services within this industry would be considered digitally delivered. Examples include producers providing digital content on a subscription basis (such as digital newspaper subscriptions and audio or visual content subscriptions), online gaming and gambling services, as well as more traditional services (such as legal or accounting services) that only have a presence online. For example, it would include universities and other tertiary education providers that interact with students entirely online, where students do not have the option to attend in person and must receive their education service digitally but would exclude education providers that offer online courses in addition to in-person courses. Similarly, it would exclude newspaper publishers that sell newspapers through physical outlets such as shops and newspaper stands as well as selling via digital newspaper subscriptions, since the publisher is interacting with consumers both digitally and physically. However, if a newspaper sells its product only via digital subscriptions, it would be included in this industry even if the newspaper is delivered to the home or office of the online subscriber.

The GMV at the firm level for digital intermediaries is defined as the total value of the goods sold on the platform in a particular year. The GMV for digital intermediaries are sourced from a range of sources, including business reports, news articles, and investor presentations. The GMV includes the intermediary platform fee along with the income earned by the dependent firm. This value has to then be adjusted to subtract the portion of value accrued to the intermediary to estimate the income earned by the firms dependent on digital intermediaries. We use the average commission rates to partition out the intermediary platform fees (see Table A9). The amount that these intermediaries receive from their revenue is based on a marketplace commission rate. This is defined as the rate that is charged by the platform to the company selling their product on the platform. The marketplace commission rate differs across platforms and industries. Based on the marketplace commission rate, the revenue for the firms selling on these accordingly computed. The marketplace commission rate varied from 10 to 20 percent across industries. 45Infobeam Solution. (n.d.).

We use the average profit margins for MSMEs49 as a proxy (for calculations, see Table A10). These estimates based on profit margins serve as a proxy for GVA but do not capture compensation to employees and may not include the consumption of fixed capital and production taxes less production subsidies, which should be included as part of GVA. In that sense, it underestimates value added by businesses selling on digital platforms. To capture the income of content creators, we use YouTube as a proxy and include YouTuber income estimates to the final result. 62  Table A10: Estimated GMV and Value-added by Firms dependent on Digital Intermediaries Sector GMV (USD Bn)GMV (INR Crore)Value-Added of Firms Dependent on Digital Intermediaries (INR Crore) Food Delivery 6 48,218 7,259 Shared Mobility 11.05 88,802 62,161 Travel 9.5 76,345 10,668 E-commerce 60 4,82,181 74,678 Total 86.55 6,95,546 1,54,766 Content Creators on Youtube 16,000 GVA of firms dependent on digital intermediaries 1,70,766 Source: https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/zomato-maintains-55-food-delivery-gmv-lead-vs-swiggy-in-cy22-kotak-123062900471_1.html;https emobilityplus.com/2022/03/10/indias-shared-mobility-industry-is-likely-to-witness-revenues-of-42-85-billion-by-2027/  63 Notes to Respondents This survey is being undertaken as a part of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) project on Measuring the Size of Indias Digital Economy, being executed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).

The portion of output from the private sector is obtained from the National Accounting Division of MoSPI. From this, the revenue attributed to the companies already included in the OECD digital industries was subtracted to avoid double-counting. Then, the estimate share of revenue that was digitally estimated from the primary surveys was applied. This was calculated as the digital share weighted by firm revenue. This provided the value of digital output by sector. This was then apportioned to digital GVA by using the ratio of GVA-to-output ratio for the respective sector. This adjustment was not done for the financial services sector because NAS provides data only on value-added and not output. The estimation for the financial services sector excludes the GVA of central banks and pension funds. Calculations are provided below.

The projected values of GVA are then estimated using a constant ratio of GVA to output of 0.728. Then, a projected digital share of GVA is applied to estimate the value of digital GVA. The projected digital share is calculated by assuming that it will grow at 25% over the next 5 years, based on the most commonly selected (modal) response in the primary survey. This calculation uses the digital share of revenue as a proxy for digital share of GVA.

While overall, this is an estimate of the total number of platform gig workers, these numbers are overestimates of the number of individuals employed by these particular platforms because many of these estimates are the number of registrations, which may be larger than the number of active partners, and some of these individuals are likely to be employed by multiple platforms and therefore double-counted. The estimated employment due to online sales by other firms selling online is calculated as follows. This estimate may include some platform gig workers as well as firms selling online through means other than intermediaries and therefore may be an overestimate. The total employment by non-agricultural unincorporated firms that receive online sales is estimated based on the ASUSE 2022-23 survey (4.10% of total employment of all firms surveyed). This is applied to the employment generated by non-agricultural unincorporated firms of 11 crore, as reported in the ASUSE 2022-23 report,61 providing as estimate of employment 45,07,004 by the subset of firms selling online. The share of employment within these firms that is attributable to digital sales is calculated by assuming that it is proportionate to the share of sales received online. This percentage (22.58%) is estimated from a survey that estimates the share of e-commerce sales in total sales for MSMEs.62  79Netherlands: ICT Usage in Enterprises Netherlands survey on ICT usage by enterprises can be found here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/ metadata/Annexes/isoc_e_simsie_nl_an_2.pdf Netherlands: Resident Digital Intermediary Platform Survey These are some sample questions translated by ICRIER from the questionnaire shared by Statistics Netherlands. This questionnaire is about online platforms. Before you move on to the content part of the questionnaire, here are a few questions to verify that you are the owner of the website or app for which this survey is intended. We also check whether your website or app is indeed an online platform. An online platform is a website or app where different people, organisations, or companies come into contact with each other and can exchange goods, services, or information. The online platform usually does not offer the goods, services, or information itself, but mainly acts as an intermediary. 1) Does your website or app mediate or support the exchange of goods, services or information between individuals, companies, or organisations? This can involve mediation or support in the sale of goods, bringing residents, patients, and family together, crowdfunding, dating, new friendships, renting out accommodations, borrowing items, etc. a) Yes b) No 2) If yes, are you, or is your company or organisation, the only provider of goods, services or information on your website or app? a) Yes b) No, in addition to our own offerings, there are also offerings from other parties c) No, there is only an offer from other partiesAppendix 11: Suggested Questions from Surveys Used by other Countries If the answer to the above is b) or c), then continue to the next question. 3) In addition to the online platform indicated in the relevant line of the letter of registration, are there any other online platforms that are part of your company or organisation? a) Yes b) No 4) If yes, what are the most important other online platforms that are part of your company or organisation?

The pilots went live in September 2020. These pilots were spread across diverse agro-climatic conditions - including areas in the western Himalayas, desert regions to Gangetic plains (spanning extreme cold of -100oC to severe heat of 480oC). They cover different types of sources including groundwater based borewells, springs in hilly areas, and surface water (river and dams). A key feature of these pilots has been the use of frugal yet sturdy sensors, which makes the solution scalable and sustainable. Several types of sensors have been deployed, including flow meters, groundwater level sensors, chlorine analyzer, pressure sensors, pump controller to measure all the relevant aspects of water service delivery  quantity, duration, quality, pressure, and sustainability  in addition to providing operational efficiencies.The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), a flagship programme of the Centre, aims to provide assured piped drinking water to every rural household across the country by 2024. Adding a new dimension to it, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry has introduced sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor the implementation of this programme in more than six lakh villages. This approach would not only allow effective monitoring and management on-ground with a futuristic vision to ensure regular tap water to every home, but real-time measurement and monitoring is also critical for rural drinking water supply schemes, with enormous gains in terms of operational efficiencies, cost reduction, grievance redressal. One of the key challenges posed to the team was to develop a robust solution at a fraction of the water infrastructure costs without compromising on quality or functionality. The pilots have led to several outcomes as it has helped identify distribution issues  such as outages, leakages, low pressure, etc. and led to resolution across sites. Several states, including Gujarat, Bihar, Haryana, and Arunachal Pradesh, have already rolled out tenders for IoT-based remote monitoring systems ranging from 500 villages to several districts. Further, states like Sikkim, Manipur, Goa, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have started the process to roll out this technology. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 16TAMIL NADU e-GOVERNANCE AGENCY (TNEGA): AI-BASED CATARACT SCREENING APP BY TNEGA Problem Solution Impact The Tamil Nadu e-Governance Agency (TNeGA) has developed an AI-based mobile app, known as ePaarwai, to address the resource constraints in screening a large number of people for cataract. By simply clicking a picture, the app can be used for preliminary screening of the eye. The app has been designed to detect macular disintegration as well. Any volunteer can join the mission of eradicating preventable blindness.India has about 4.7 million blind people, and about 66 percent of them lose their eyesight due to cataract. Undiagnosed cataract remains a huge problem especially in rural areas and among low-income settlements in urban areas, owing to the lack of trained professionals and other resources. Therefore, cataract is a major public health problem in India. Launched with help of Tamil Nadu State Blind Control Society (TNSBCS), the app is being tested in a few districts. The results from the field trials are very encouraging. If these efforts succeed, it would help millions of elderly people in the villages and in urban low-income settlements from losing their eyesight. The app has the potential to create big impact in the state. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 17MYGOV , MEITY: COMBATTING COVID-19 INFODEMIC WITH AI VIRTUAL ASSISTANT Problem Solution Impact The Government of Indias Digital India Corporation (MyGov) sought to equip its 1.3 billion citizens with a responsible AI tool that provides accurate and useful information on the pandemic. Working together with Accenture and Microsoft, MyGov moved fast to develop an AI-powered virtual agent in days. Referred to as MyGov Saathi (meaning companion in English), the agent harnesses the capabilities of Microsofts Power Virtual Agent and Azure. MyGov Saathi was embedded on the self4society microsite of MyGov. This persona-based chatbot was tuned to provide customized answers for queries relevant to farmers, migrants, senior citizens, frontline workers and other citizens alike so they all adopt behaviours that minimize transmission and exposure to the coronavirus. As guidance changes, the agent is updated with the most recent data on COVID-19, ensuring latest information is available to users.In the early months of the pandemic; India, like other countries around the world, was facing a steep increase in COVID-19 cases. By late May, more than 154,000 people had contracted the virus. But, as the country confronted the pandemic, it also sought to curb the spread of rumours. To fight the so-called infodemic, the Indian Government wanted to proactively help its people find accurate information that would better prepare them for the crisis and empower them to reduce their risk of contracting the virus. The Government sought easy-to-use, efficient tools that could keep pace with evolving guidance about COVID-19. MyGov Saathi is available on online platforms, including MyGov.in, WhatsApp and Facebook. By managing interactions automatically, this virtual agent freed up human experts to focus on the most urgent and complex situations. The AI agent addressed frequently asked questions, with users able to retrieve answers from a menu of options easily. The agent also delivered fact sheets, information on government initiatives, professional and medical advice, and alerts and lists of myth busters to dispel false alarms. MyGov Saathi can handle up to 300,000 users per day and 20,000 concurrent users per minute. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 18PUNJAB AGRI EXPORT CORPORATION: USING AI FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SEED POTATOES Problem Solution Impact PAGREXCO partnered with Bengaluru based CropIn to enable the traceability of potato seeds in the entire value chain. Their advanced farm data management solution was used to capture several parameters through every stage of production and monitor them systematically to produce superior quality seed potatoes. The PAGREXCO field teams configured the best solutions of practices for each seed variety on CropIns platform and also received real-time intelligence reports about local weather, crop growth, crop health, potential pest infestations, and crop diseases. The quality of the potato and its nutritional value highly depends on the quality of seed potatoes that are used to cultivate them. Punjab is known for its high-quality seed potatoes. Punjab produces 27 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes every year. The state also provides to nearly 70 percent of the entire seed potato demand in the Indian market including the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka. Yet, only less than 1 percent of all seed potatoes produced in Punjab are currently certified by the Punjab Seed Certification Authority. This makes it extremely difficult for potato growers to differentiate original seeds from counterfeit ones. The spurious potatoes sold in the name of Punjab-grown seed potato severely impact the credibility and the brand value of the seeds. To solve this and to expand the certification process, the Punjab Agri Export Corporation (PAGREXCO) decided to leverage AI-based solutions for Seed Potato Traceability. This helped seed potato growers in Punjab to cultivate superior quality seeds and improve their efficiency. The solution facilitated two-way communication between PAGREXCO and farmers, allowing managers to share important plans, advisories, and instruction videos, and facilitating for farmers to have instant access to the PAGREXCO team. Capturing farm data at critical points established end-to-end traceability to the life cycle of seeds. Following tests for quality assurance and certification by PAGREXCO, unique QR codes are printed on each of the seed potato packets during the packaging and warehousing process. This enabled buyers to trace the origin of the seed potatoes and determine exactly where the seeds are coming from, how the seed potatoes were cultivated, and whether they are PAGREXCO certified or not. Farmers registered under this platform also received timely reminders and alerts for critical field activities, periodic weather alerts, prompt pest, disease alert resolution, and active on-field support from PAGREXCO extension team. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 19TELANGANA EMERGING TECH DIVISION: REAL-TIME DIGITAL AUTHENTICATION OF IDENTITY (RTDAI) IN AUTHENTICATING PENSIONERS Problem Solution Impact Telangana state government has implemented the Real-time Digital Authentication of Identity (RTDAI) in authenticating pensioners. A smartphone is the only hardware requirement on the user end as fingerprints or iris images are not required. The beneficiaries have to take a photo and upload it to the exclusive app, which is offered as a part of the T App Folio  the umbrella app for Telanganas e-governance initiatives. The Pensioners Life Certificate Authentication through Selfie (PLCS) method deploys three levels of authentication: demographics (name, fathers name and address), photo and liveness. PLCS uses AI based liveness check solution, big data and machine learning based demographic check solution, and deep learning based image comparison solution. The AI, ML and deep learning solutions quickly check the details submitted by the user with the information piled up in public data systems.Getting the annual life certificate is a cumbersome task for pensioners as they have to travel long distances to a government establishment for submitting proof of liveness and establishing identity. This manual process, mandating physical presence of the old pensioners, is not very convenient for the citizens or the authorities, and there is often scope for errors. The Telengana government has scrapped the old system and replaced it with an app-based authentication. All that is needed is a smartphone and internet, and by uploading a freshly-taken selfie on the app, the pensioners can bypass the otherwise tedious process of visiting the local treasury department to get the pension. The whole process takes just under one minute to find answers for the two crucial questions in authenticating a pensioner  Whether the pensioner in question is alive? Is she or he the legitimate pensioner? The AI tools can address challenges such as identifying old pictures in the data base from the latest photos of users as the system can detect the changes happened in faces over a period of time. Similarly with the names, the AI-enabled system can match names even with minor variation in spellings as it checks other parameters in the data, such as address or fathers name. The success rate in authentication of pensioners is about 93 percent, and it can be as high as 96-98 percent as the system learns and improves over time. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 20ANDHRA PRADESH GOVERNMENT  PENSIONS: AI-BASED REAL-TIME BENEFICIARY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM Problem Solution Impact The Andhra Pradesh government has announced the introduction of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Real- time Beneficiary Identification System (RBIS) in October 2020. The move comes as part of the nine promises, the Navarathnalu, made by the YSRCP during the election under which the government pays pensions to over 61 lakh people from poor and vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, widows, single women, persons with disability and several other such citizens.The present PDO system in Andhra Pradesh that is in place for pensioner identification, is full of defects leading to misappropriation of funds. This is so because the social security pensions are not uniform for all groups. It ranges from Rs 2250 per month for groups such as senior citizens, widows, toddy tappers, weavers while for disabled persons, transgenders and dappu artists, it is Rs 3000 per month and those with chronic kidney diseases are entitled Rs 10,000 per month. The process of proper fund disbursement is often incomplete due to reasons such as smudged thumb impressions or no impressions at all. The new system will make things transparent as it allows people to authenticate by facial recognition on a real-time basis. This will curb corruption that was rampant during the old system as the volunteers would take advantage of the uneducated villagers. The new AI-based authentication system was deployed in East and West Godavaris and Krishna districts as pilot projects and after being tested successful is being introduced across the state. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 21UTTAR PRADESH STATE GOVERNMENT  STAQU: AI VIDEO SURVEILLANCE PLATFORM FOR PRISONS Problem Solution Impact Use of AI to monitor prisons. UP is the only state in the country to harness AI for prison monitoring and supervision which houses 24 percent of Indias total jail inmates. The video analytics platform JARVIS has been deployed in 70 prisons to monitor inmates since December 2019. The software has helped the jailers in disciplining and overseeing the prisoners in the past one and a half years. Over the years states like UP , Rajasthan and Punjab face huge challenge of increasing crime rates. Due to limited resources, the state law enforcements agencies have been increasingly turning towards tech-based solutions for criminal investigations and surveillance. Such agencies have often resorted to AI to reduce criminal activities. The Uttar Pradesh Government, in a first for India, have used AI-enabled video analytics platform to monitor prison inmates. UP Police and Gurgaon-based Staqu implemented JARVIS Video Wall to monitor real time footage from CCTV cameras across a vast network, and then flagged any segment that looked to contain unlawful activity. JARVIS runs Real-time video data analysis from over 700 cameras installed across 70 prisons in UP with 24/7 data feeds on parameters such as frisking of inmates, visitors facial and image recognition, crowd analysis, unauthorized access, intrusion detection and fights. Key UP police officials access Mobile App for Real-time insights on potential threats covering 900 km area across parameters like violence, unauthorized intrusions, illegal mobile phone and weapons. For this remarkable initiative, the UP prison department received the prestigious FICCI Smart Policing award for 2021. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 22TELANGANA EMERGING TECHNOLOGY DIVSION: DRONE- BASED DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE SUPPLY Problem Solution Impact The Medicine from the Sky project involves drone-based deliveries of blood, vaccines, medical samples and organs. As a pilot, 16 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) around Vikarabad area hospital have been selected owing to the presence of cold chain facilities and the PHCs within the Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) range. It needs to be mentioned here that BVLOS drone flights will be used for deliveries using the identified airspace of the Vikarabad district. Based on the success, large scale commercial deployment will be planned. Providing medicines and other healthcare items in remote rural areas in a quick and safe way has always remained a challenge for the government of Telangana. To counter this, the Telangana government launched Medicine from the Sky initiative in partnership with World Economic Forum, NITI Aayog, and HealthNet Global. The objective of the project is to enable emergency medical deliveries that could include COVID-19 vaccines and other essentials and integrate drone deliveries with the existing systems and upgrade rural healthcare infrastructure to the urban level. The project has been planned to be launched in three waves starting with pilot followed by mapping of the route network for operation of drones. For this, approval has been granted by the Civil Aviation Ministry and the State has been permitted to conduct the experimental flights for a period of one year. To implement the project, companies have been asked to submit SOPs along with the risk mitigation plans to the DG of Civil Aviation for approval. The pilot project is expected to last for 24 days where four batches would carry out sorties for six days each. In the first 2 days, the flights will be transporting only essentials followed by the others. The project, the first of its kind in the country, is expected to enable better decision-making in healthcare supply chains and execute last-mile deliveries with minimum glitches and thereby augment the national healthcare programs. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 23DRDO: USING CHEST X-RAYS  AI TO DETECT COVID-19 INDUCED LUNG DAMAGE Problem Solution Impact TCAIR, DRDO has developed an AI-based intelligent, secure, web based, COVID detection application software ATMAN using Chest X-rays which can classify the images into normal, COVID-19 and pneumonia classes using limited number of sample images. The secure web-based solution was developed on the premise of optimizing chest X-rays for rapid detection of COVID-19 triggered lung abnormalities. For this, the DRDO has also roped in HCG Academics and Bangalore-based deep tech startup 5C Network. Using Indian datasets from COVID-19 positive patients, the dataset comprised of 1,324 COVID-19, 1,108 Normal, and 1,344 Pneumonia CXR images. Transfer learning was carried out on Indian dataset using popular deep neural networks, which included DenseNet, ResNet50, and ResNet18 network architectures to classify CXRs into three categories. The model was retrospectively used to test CXRs from RT-PCR proven COVID-19 patients to test positive predictive value and accuracy.As the COVID-19 pandemic is steadily making its way into the rural pockets, it is presumed that access to CT scans and radiologists will be even tougher. Realizing the need for early and timely CT scans at an affordable rate, DRDO has developed ATMAN AI, an AI-based COVID detection application software using chest X-rays (CXR) to detect COVID induced lung abnormalities. As CXRs are economical than CT scans, the solution does not increment the challenges PHCs and smaller healthcare facilities already face. Based on the initial screening results, the solution is recommended for mass testing by the doctors. To help scale up this project, 5C Network enabled access to radiologists anywhere through its public cloud and AI-based infrastructure, effectively addressing the challenge of a skewed patient to radiologist ratio using technology. The turnaround time for the deployment of the solution is a matter of days and the reach can be increased many folds due to the remote, accessible nature of the 5C Network Platform. At present, an MoU has been signed with the government of Karnataka to deploy ATMAN across 194 PHCs across the state, with other such rollouts being targeted in the near future. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 24ANDHRA PRADESH TRANSMISSION CORPORATION: FORECASTING ENERGY NEEDS USING AI Problem Solution Impact The forecasting model is being developed by Google and World Bank together, with SLDC working on the initiative in-house. As the system gets deployed, APTRANSCO aims to extend the day-ahead forecasting models for wind energy, solar energy, market prices, central generating stations surplus and frequency. APTRANSCO is also working on a low-cost model for electricity dispatch. The model will generate data to inform about how much electricity should be generated and dispatched every 15 minutes, the next day from generating stations so that there are reduced costs arising from power purchasing.The Andhra Pradesh government is aiming to build the most efficient and financially robust power sector to address future power demand and supply cost-effective power to consumers with zero interruption. The Andhra Pradesh Transmission Corporation (APTRANSCO), for the first time in India, released the day-ahead electricity forecasting model using AI and ML to forecast next days electricity consumption, including a day-ahead electricity demand for every 15 minutes. The development will enable the AP State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) officials to take decisions on electricity demand and supply, grid management and minimise power purchase cost. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 25KERALA STATE GOVERNMENT  CORONASAFE NETWORK: AN OPEN-SOURCE PUBLIC UTILITY DASHBOARD Problem Solution Impact The CoronaSafe Network is an open-source public utility designed by a multi-disciplinary team of innovators and volunteers to protect the healthcare system of Kerala from a meltdown due to overload beyond capacity. The tech talent, led by Kerala Start-up villages Sanjay Vijaykumar, built the open-source public software. This software has various elements including telemedicine call management, directory of ambulances, blood banks, food delivery services, hospitals, number of beds and oxygen supply points. The dashboard provides real-time analytics of beds, ICUs and ventilators, real-time oxygen monitoring, capacity visualization for load balancing, facility management with inventory tracking, triage, telehealth facilities, integrated ambulance shifting, patient management and clinical data visualisation. Alerts and notifications are sent in real-time as well. A crucial element that has been factored in is data privacy - patient data is securely stored on cloud service providers empanelled with MeitY and server access resides with state-appointed health departments. In addition, APIs have public and private end points with appropriate authorisation for system and cross-device integration. All the tools are free and open-source software, with the source code available on GitHub. COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in our lives for over a year and half now and still shows no sign of abating. As India reels under an unrelenting second wave, healthcare and frontline workers struggle to cope with the rising cases and critical resources like beds and oxygen cannisters are in short supply. In a community spirit that will be remembered for years to come, good samaritans have mobilized their time, skills and energies to crowd-source supplies for those in need on the back of technologies such as AI. The state of Kerala has been handling this surge in demand for beds and oxygen cannisters through a centralised control room built on an open-source software called CoronaSafe Network. The coordinated effort was a success in Kochi and Ernakulam which prompted its implementation in every district under the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA). The Network has been successful in creating awareness on COVID-19 and converting educational institutions into hospitals to offset for shortages. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 26TAMIL NADU EGOVERNANCE AGENCY: DL-FRS- A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION-BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM Problem Solution Impact This calls for an unobtrusive and accurate system that does not rely on any manual work by the teachers. TNeGA has developed a cost-effective DL-FRS, a deep learning approach for facial recognition-based attendance system, which runs on lightweight edge computing device, with an integrated camera. Students can just walk into the school and the system automatically, recognizes each of them by face and marks their attendance. The user-friendly attendance management application helps school management in effective tracking of attendance records. One of the challenges that public schools in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, are struggling to address is that of student attendance. Manual marking of attendance tends to waste the limited teaching resources of a school, in addition to being prone to errors and manipulation. The objective of the initiative is to help teachers in reducing the burden of manual attendance marking and providing an attendance management solution for maintaining and managing attendance records in safe and secure way. Earlier, teachers used to spend more than 45 minutes on attendance marking which has been reduced significantly. Students happily walk into the school and without any complicated process the attendance gets marked by the face recognition system. With the user-friendly FRS, teachers can easily track attendance of students, download, print and manage attendance records at ease with minimal time and effort. Another unintended impact noticed after the implementation was schools started to see 85 percent drop in latecomers and in turn improving overall productivity of the class. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 27THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA: AI FOR REFORMING JUSTICE DELIVERY IN INDIA Problem Approach Impact The apex court has launched a pioneering effort to use AI to aid legal research for judges. The AI portal SUPACE, short for Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Courts Efficiency, has been introduced in April 2021. SUPACE is AI-enabled assistive tool that can augment the efficiency of the legal researchers and judges to work on cases, extract relevant information, read case files, manage teamwork, and draft case documents. The AI-powered workflow of SUPACE has four parts: file preview, chatbot, logic gate and notebook. The case files, typically available as PDFs, can be converted into text. The text and voice enabled chatbot helps to give quick overview of the case. The fact extraction system gives information about the case such as overview, chronology, judgement and so on. Finally, an integrated word processor truly makes the tool an end-to-end system. This entire system is subject to training by human users. The AI system learns patterns based on the information thats annotated and extracted  and thats how its trained.The pendency of cases in Indias courts has been a long-standing challenge with no viable solution in sight. While the total number of pending cases stands at almost 44 million across all Indian courts, it is higher than 67,000 for just the Supreme Court (as of April 2021). Apart from pendency, there are problems in culling out facts from the records because of the bulky volumes being filed in the court. It was in this backdrop that an Artificial Intelligence Committee of the Supreme Court was constituted in 2019 for onboarding new-age technology of AI/ML in the judicial domain for enhancing the efficiency of justice delivery. SUPACE is an online portal that is accessible through a login ID and password. It provides a digital infrastructure that can further the efforts and fulfil the purpose of the digitization movement happening across the country. SUPACE, with its robust workflow and machine learning abilities, will truly unlock the unutilised power of digitization. All high court judges have been recommended to start using SUPACE to enhance their efficiency. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 28TAMIL NADU EGOVERNANCE AGENCY: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO ADVISE FARMERS ON PESTS AND DISEASES IN CROPS Problem Solution TNeGA aims to use this data to improve the solution and to provide even better support to farmers as well other involved stakeholders.GIS coordinatesCrop stageUser QueryImages of diseased/ infected plants/ leaves 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 28Worldwide, crops are affected by various pests and diseases. Most of farmlands are owned by small and marginal farmers in India who do not have access to right resources and are often misguided by a few fertilizer vendors and hence, they face a lot of crop damage and related challenges, ultimately leading to significant loss of income that affect their livelihood. This directly impacts farmers and their family and eventually economy which is directly dependent on agriculture. TNeGAs has piloted a farmer friendly and easily accesibe, AI-powered solution which can work on smart mobile phone designed to help farmers with early identification of these pests and diseases, which would be very helpful to mitigate farmer distress compared to traditional approaches. Deep supervised learning in recent years has been successfully used for pattern identification from digital images. TNeGA has implemented a solution for two crops Paddy and Maize for detecting 3 major issues using deep learning based model, which is trained based on a pre-built knowledge base to identify diseases and pests from digital images. The images were majorly collected from fields in the state of Tamil Nadu across 33 districts. Data was collected with the help of field experts, employed by the state government, who usually advise farmers and are familiar with local conditions. The solution employed is able to detect the issues with upto 80 percent accuracy. TNeGA aims to support variety of cases to cover various crop types. To achieve this goal TNeGA has also setup a system to collect data directly from ground and process to consume it for training models to support various crop types. The data collected contains following details: 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 29Impact 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 29Given the ratio of farmers to ground experts in the state of Tamil Nadu, its almost impossible to serve each and every farmer physically on daily basis. With this TNeGA with Agriculture Department was able to serve around 10,000 requests from farmers in a span of 3-4 months given almost no publicity of its existence. The other benefits of the system is that its able to serve farmers in their local language and hence has more reach. With all the requests from Agriculture Department, it was able to build rich dataset and based on data analysis is able validate stressed regions and also signals for onset of any diseases or pests by visualizing the patterns. Daily requests analysis will also lead to identification of various hidden resource related problems and help to tackle them carefully. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 30MAHARASHTRA STATE GOVT  HAPTIK: AI-ENABLED CHATBOT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PUBLIC SERVICES Problem Solution In March 2019, the Government of Maharashtra partnered with Haptik Infotech Pvt Ltd (an enterprise conversational Al platform) and announced a new AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot is known as Aaple Sarkar Bot and allows access to information regarding public services managed by the state government. It can be accessed on the Aaple Sarkar Right to Services (RTS) websites. As part of the Right to Services Act of 2015, the bot is deployed to complement existing mobile apps and websites that help with queries related to healthcare, education, public utilities, rural development, revenue, and other public related services. The chatbot comprises a range of algorithms that gives the ability to process many queries every day, such as analyzing, maintaining records and providing the user with the most useful information. Haptik used its own personalized tool for creating the bot which comprised of 3 parts called bot-builder, human chat agent and analytic dashboard. The Maharashtra Government provided various APIs and information extract from multiple sectors to the company. An individual can search for services such as permanent water connection, driving license and access related information including prerequisites for the application, tracking the status of the application, monitoring progress, etc.One of the key challenges the government of Maharashtra identified is the amount of time consumed for the delivery of government services and in the processing of paperwork. The government initiated an idea to give the desired services in a time-bound, transparent and predictable manner with minimum human interference. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 31Impact The bot has substantially benefited users by providing instantaneous, accurate, transparent and complete information, as well as enabling them to track services offered by the government. The platform has already received an overwhelming response from people around the State. In March 2019, Aakrit Vaish, co-founder and CEO of Haptik announced that the bot would be compatible with Marathi and Gujarati languages soon which will further allow people from the remote areas to interact with the website in their language. The company is also looking to create such bots for other states as well. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 32UTTAR PRADESH STATE GOVT: AI IS BEING USED BY THE POLICE TO CATCH CRIMINALS Problem As of 2016, Uttar Pradesh (UP) had the highest incidences of crime with a crime rate of 128.7 per 100,000 people. The UP Police became concerned with the inability to solve criminal cases rapidly and efficiently. Therefore, the police began to boost its efficiency by using various technologies such as crime mapping analytics and predictive systems (in partnership with ISRO). 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 33Solution Impact In December 2018, the Director-General of Police Om Prakash Singh launched an AI-powered mobile application named Trinetra. Trinetra has a record of 5 lakh criminals which contains a picture, address and criminal history of each criminal. This information has been collected through the inputs from district police, prison department and Government Railway Police (GRP). It is powered by Staqus facial recognition, visual search, machine learning, and deep learning solutions and works well with low-resolution images and videos. The application offers better accuracy with AI-powered Gang Identification Technology. Trinetra not only identifies a criminal but also find their associates active in different parts of the state. The mobile application is connected to the data from all the prisons, DCRBs, SCRB, and CCTNS and creates non-ambiguous, non-repetitive data of criminals active in the state. It is also linked with the present Under Trial Management System (UTMS) that keeps track of the status of all undertrials across the state. This information can be accessed by any officer using the application in real-time. The use of this application helps police personnel easily register or search for criminals via simple biometric features, such as images or videos. Trinetra has assisted the police in catching one high-profile criminal accused of a daytime shoot-out in Lucknow. Trinetra is expected to reach 75 districts, 6 GRP , ATS (Anti-Terrorist Squads), and STF (Special Task Force). The application will be used by 1,464 station house officers in the state, 65 GRP inspectors and all other senior police officials. The police, in partnership with Staqu, intends to introduce vehicle search technology on the mobile application, along with enable search by voice samples through its advanced AI-powered speaker identification technology. Also, the application aims to support fingerprint-based identification and active geo-fencing of police personnel. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 34NATIONAL HIGHW AYS AUTHORITIES OF INDIA: AI-BASED ATTENDANCE FOR FIELD STAFF Problem Solution Impact The AI system will also have the feature of real-time location tracking of personnel at project sites including key personnel, engineers and consultants. Further, the NHAIs system which is cloud-enabled as well as powered by the data analytics platform - Data Lake which will enable the system to tag each personnel with unique identification and monitoring which will help check unauthorized absenteeism as well as improve the quality of construction and project management. The National Highways Authorities of India (NHAI) has deployed Artificial Intelligence (AI) based face recognition system to monitor attendance of the field staff at different project locations. This move has been undertaken by the NHAI as a step to increase transparency and accountability. This system will enable employees to log on using their mobile phones via an app and will capture employee details, date, time and location of the employees when they log in for the day and will prevent impersonation of employees/ consultants/ engineers. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 35 STARTUPS 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 36AGNEXT: IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAGNEXT  AI-POWERED TEA CROP QUALITY SOLUTION Problem Certain stakeholders in the tea industry value chain often surreptitiously enhance the relative weight of the harvested/plucked tea leaves by moistening the leaves with water. This is done to increase the volume of the harvested tea leaf crop for a higher price realization. This is not only illegal but also detrimental to the quality of the tea harvest - the moisture reduces shelf life of the tea leaves. When any tea processing company/manufacturer procures tea leaves, the company determines the quality and price of the product using the Fine Leaf Count (FLC) benchmark. The quality of the product is tested and validated on the basis of the FLC. While FLC is used to estimate the price of the leaves, the presence of moisture distorts the quality of the tea leaf and the final product. Goodricke, an Indian tea producing company, procures tea from several sellers. The company often procured the tea at an inflated price because of the presence of water/moisture in the tea leaves - this led to higher input costs for the same volume of tea harvest/produce. Moreover, the reduced shelf life of the tea leaves leads to further losses of revenue because of the spoilage of the tea produce. Currently, there are two traditional methods used by processing centers to determine the fine leaf count: weight based and Tocklai Ballometric (TB) Count based. The weight-based method, which has been traditionally used because of the agility of the process, is not very accurate and can be manipulated. Though the Tocklai Ballometric method is very accurate, it is very time consuming as the number of fine leaves need to be counted manually. Moreover, the manual quality process was prone to subjectivity. Hence, there was a requirement for a centralized digital solution to determine the quality of the tea crop/tea leaves by measuring the presence of water/moisture in the tea leaves. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 37Solution Impact AgNext developed an AI-based application called TragNext to identify the quality of agricultural produce, including tea leaves. The pilot solution was set up in association with the Tea Research Association to accurately measure the fine leaf count and the quality of the tea leaves. TragNext automatically determined the fine leaf count and the moisture component without human intervention, removing subjectivity from the quality checking process. This solution reduced the quality-checking process to seconds, and improved overall accuracy. The team at AgNext leveraged several functions of data science to build a portable futuristic platform for an accurate and instant food/tea leaf assessment solution. The system was developed by utilizing deep learning sciences in combination with spectral technologies. As part of the solution, AgNext developed a mechanism to store the details of the tea leafs moisture on the cloud - these details could then be accessed by any of the stakeholders. The platform enabled the analysis of the quality of the tea leaves by utilizing several assessments using AI. Goodricke also leveraged a machine-based physical installation, that provided real-time FLC estimation for samples up to 2kg. The system had three components  a dryer, a separator and an AI-enabled system. Calculations were done via a CV camera that was mounted over the last conveyor belt during processing - the camera recorded the samples movement to give the FLC - Fine Leaf Count. Further, a web-based dashboard provided the complete information of the farmers registered in the system and the history of the batch quality associated with them. The payments made to the farmers were also managed from the dashboard. To utilize the application/solution, tea leaves were spread evenly on a white surface - the image was taken and uploaded to the app. The results were calculated and displayed within 1 minute. The solution enabled Goodricke to carry out an accurate and immediate check on the quality of the tea produce and completely eliminate human errors - a 100 percent error reduction. The TragNext solution is fast becoming the determining factor for quality and price valuation. The initial deployments included estates of tea companies such as Goodricke, Rossell Tea, and Bokahola Tea. The Tea Board of India has also installed this solution in West Bengal and Assam. With the growing demand, TragNext is now deployed at CISTA or Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers Association - at Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 38NIRAMAI: BEATING BREAST CANCER THROUGH AI- ENABLED EARLY DETECTION SOFTW ARE Problem Solution Impact NIRAMAI Health Analytix is a Bangalore-based deep tech startup, which stands for Non-Invasive Risk Assessment with Machine Intelligence. They have developed a new cancer screening software that uses machine intelligence over thermography images to detect breast cancer at a much earlier stage than traditional methods or self- examination. The core of the solution is Thermalytix, a computer-aided diagnostic engine that is powered by AI. SMILE (Software with Machine Intelligence for Life Enhancement) is a web interface for the NIRAMAI certified technician to upload demography information about the patient along with her thermal images. Big data analytics, AI  ML are leveraged to analyze the patients breast health condition, automatically generating a report listing certain unique parameters and recommending a breast health score. This method of screening can detect tumours five times smaller than what clinical exam can detect. It is a low cost, accurate, automated, portable cancer screening tool that can be operated by a simple clinician. Unlike mammography, this imaging method is radiation free, non- touch, not painful and works for women of all ages. NIRAMAI provide complete hardware-software solution for breast cancer screening in three modes. (a) Sturdy, compact screening device with cloud processing for specialty hospitals (b) Low-cost, handheld device with real-time cloud-based diagnostics for independent medical practitioners (c) A portable solution for large-scale screenings. The innovative methods used in the solution have led to multiple US patents. The cancer screening tool, SMILE, has been tested on more than 4000 women in 12 hospitals/diagnostic centers as well as screening camps. 3 clinical trials, comparing Thermalytix with current standards of care, have been published in peer reviewed conference/journals. The results from these clinical trials indicate very high accuracy of Thermalytix that is comparable to, and sometimes better than, Mammography.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women today. According to WHO, 1 in every 12 women have the risk of a breast abnormality. Indian women have only about 50 percent chance of survival. Early diagnosis is very critical to decrease mortality rates. The current gold standard for breast cancer screening, mammography, requires high capital cost for equipment and experienced radiographers. It is recommended once every 2 years and only to women above 45 years because it cannot identify tumours effectively for younger women, and uses of X-rays for scanning, which can make women more susceptible to cancer if screened multiple times. In addition, it is also very painful for the subject as about 20 pounds weight is applied on the breasts while screening. Other common method of clinical exam can detect tumours only after they are large enough to be palpable. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 39TRICOG: AI FOR DIAGNOSING CARDIOV ASCULAR CONDITIONS Problem Solution Impact Tricog was founded in 2015 with a vision of expediting cardiac diagnosis and accelerating treatment. It does this by providing accurate (physician-verified) ECG reports within a few minutes of taking ECG at remote centres. If any patient is found to be critical, Tricog works with tertiary hospitals in their neighbourhood to accelerate treatment. Tricog is also actively engaged in building a specialised product for coordinating cardiac care across primary healthcare centres, ambulances and tertiary hospitals. Tricogs solution consists of cloud-connected ECG machines placed at various remote centres, which continuously push ECGs to the Tricog cloud. Proprietary algorithms first analyze the ECGs and provide preliminary interpretation for verification by the in-house team of cardiac specialists who are present 24/7 at Tricogs centralized ECG Analysis Hub. The physician-verified reports are then sent back via SMS/app to the remote centre. Approximately 31 percent of deaths globally are due to Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), out of which heart attacks and strokes account for 85 percent. In the last 26 years, there has been a 34 percent rise in deaths due to heart diseases in India. Three million people have died in India due to CVDs. While ECG machines are readily available in India, reading ECG, which is the first step in detecting any heart-related abnormalities, requires the skills of a cardiologist or an experienced physician since machine-embedded algorithms have only a 70 percent accuracy rate. There is a shortage of heart specialists in India. This results in frequent occurrences of misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis. By providing ECG diagnosis within minutes and architecting a low-cost solution, Tricog addresses the delay in response, which significantly decreases the risk of mortality. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 40HAPTIK: CONVERSATIONAL AI PLATFORM BY HAPTIK AI FOR HEALTHKART Problem Solution Impact HealthKart sought a solution that could build new chat flows or modify the enterprises existing flows.

MAHENDRAN: AI-POWERED BACKPACK HELPS THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED NAVIGATE WORLD Problem Solution Artificial intelligence (AI) developer Jagadish K. Mahendran and his team designed an AI-powered, voice-activated backpack that can help the visually impaired navigate and perceive the world around them. The system is housed inside a small backpack containing a host computing unit, such as a laptop. A vest jacket conceals a camera, and a fanny pack is used to hold a pocket-size battery pack capable of providing approximately eight hours of use. A Luxonis OAK-D spatial AI camera can be affixed to either the vest or fanny pack, then connected to the computing unit in the backpack. Three tiny holes in the vest provide viewports for the OAK-D, which is attached to the inside of the vest. The OAK-D unit is a versatile and powerful AI device that runs on Intel Movidius VPU and the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit for on-chip edge AI inferencing. It is capable of running advanced neural networks while providing accelerated computer vision functions and a real-time depth map from its stereo pair, as well as colour information from a single 4k camera. A bluetooth-enabled earphone lets the user interact with the system via voice queries and commands, and the system responds with verbal information. As the user moves through their environment, the system audibly conveys information about common obstacles including signs, tree branches and pedestrians. It also warns of upcoming crosswalks, curbs, staircases and entryways.The difficulties people with visual impairments experience in navigating through the world-especially in public spaces are both obvious and, many times, profound. Their lives and opportunities are often seriously impacted by the need to depend on others for assistance in simply getting to work, going shopping, meeting friends, and on and on. What sighted people take for granted often becomes an enormous obstacle that the visually impaired must deal with on a daily basis. Meanwhile, visual assistance systems for navigation are fairly limited and range from global positioning system-based, voice-assisted smartphone apps to camera-enabled smart walking stick solutions. These systems lack the depth perception necessary to facilitate independent navigation. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 42Impact The backpack helps detect common challenges such as traffic signs, hanging obstacles, crosswalks, moving objects and changing elevations, all while running on a low-power, interactive device. Visually impaired users can take advantage of the system for both indoor and outdoor navigation, as well as for gaining an understanding of their local environment. Simple to put on, its inconspicuous, and the user can take advantage of the system to walk freely on public streets without attracting undesired attention. Jagadish K. Mahendran won the grand prize in the OpenCV Spatial AI 2020 Competition, the worlds largest spatial AI competition. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 43BOBBLE AI: AI-BASED CONVERSATIONAL MEDIA MARKETING PLATFORM FOR ITC SUNFEAST Problem Solution ITCs Sunfeast YiPPee! was actively exploring content and marketing avenues, such as TV and print advertisements, to reach a wider audience and become an integral part of customer conversations.

The objective is to bring sports closer to fans through interesting ways of engagement using real-time sports analytics. This unique non-intrusive sensor platform (weighs less than 5 grams) is fixed behind a bat as a sticker to measure the quality, speed, twist, and swing of a bat and the power transferred from the ball to bat at impact. These parameters are used to compute the quality of a shot and help professional as well as amateur players and coaches to improve performance with data-driven feedback. The data from the power bats are analyzed with powerful AI-models developed in Microsoft Azure and transferred to the edge for providing continuous feedback to the player. The sticker communicates using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with an edge device called Stump Box that is hidden behind the wicket. The data from the Stump Box is transferred and analyzed in Azure and shot characteristics are provided to broadcasters in real-time. To ensure secure communication between the bat, edge device and Microsoft Azure, Stump Box has been powered by Microsoft Azure Sphere based hardware platform. The smart bat pairs with Spektacom mobile app to transfer and analyze sticker data in Azure. Currently, only three main data points are being collected, which are speed and twist of the bats impact with the ball and the quality of the shot.The popularity of cricket has increased very rapidly in recent times, and as a result, innovative methods for improving batting techniques arose. This has also led to a need for data-driven assistance for players to assess the quality of their game. Spektacom has already debuted the technology at the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL). The company believes that this technology will enhance fan experience and engagement with the sport and will also help coaches to provide more intensely focused guidance to players. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 47LEARNING MATTERS: AI VOICE ASSISTANT TO IMPROVE TEACHERS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY Problem Solution Impact A teachers language proficiency is a key element that decides the efficacy of teaching in any educational scenario. If the teacher doesnt have good command over the language, even meticulously-planned instructional design will deliver poor learning outcomes for the students. Teachers in semi-urban and rural schools have very limited exposure and experience in English. Meaningful conversational English is a herculean challenge for teachers in the classroom. This has a direct impact on the students. Failing to understand the language leads to poor performance. Learning Matters Tara focuses on increasing the teachers vocabulary, thereby improving communicative skills with the proper use of grammar constructs. This is achieved by our carefully-designed training modules and pedagogical approach to language learning. Tara is a dynamic, two-way interactive, personalised teacher assistant that works on Amazons Echo Dot, Google Home, and smartphones. Tara uses voice-assisted technology to incorporate the four critical components of language learning - Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing (LSRW). Tara mimics a human teacher by listening, responding to the learners utterances, providing feedback and correcting grammatical mistakes, repeating lessons, and conversing with learners, over and over again, tirelessly. This helps learners learn at their pace by repeated practice to gain proficiency in the language. Tara also creates a non-judgemental learning environment in which learners can speak confidently without the fear of being judged. The lessons are based on real-life situations and everyday conversations. This gives learners the appropriate context to practice speaking in English. Prior to beginning the programme with Tara, a baseline assessment of teachers is carried out to assess their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills on a scale of 5. The assessment is designed to reflect the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) guidelines for languages. The teachers are then mapped to CEFR levels of A1 and pre-A1 based on their scores. Teachers are assessed once again three months after the course commencement and one last time for the year, six months afterwards. They are assessed on the following parameters: grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, pronunciation and expression. Tara allows every teachers individual progress to be tracked which helps to generate a monthly performance report. As well, teachers who are struggling with content and need customized interventions can be identified. Periodic generation of reports ensures that the sessions with Tara are being followed as per schedule and performance monitored. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 48CHALO APP: SIMPLIFYING BUS JOURNEY Problem Buses are the most common and preferred mode of transport across both rural and urban areas in India. While the ease of availability and the affordable prices are the primary reasons for preferring such journey, there are multiple challenges affecting the bus transportation system. From waiting for buses to buying a ticket, there are numerous hassles associated with a simple journey. While the easy answer is booking an Uber or Ola, the aam admi might not be so privileged to book a joyful ride. Having realized this, Vinayak Bhavnani, Mohit Dubey, Priya Singh Dubey and Dhruv Chopra wanted to change all of this, and make the intercity bus experience digitized, comfortable and easy for Indians. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 49Solution Impact Chalo (previously known as Zophop) was launched in 2014 in Mumbai with the focus on improving existing public transport with technologies. One of the ideas was building a multi-modal trip planner that can provide suggestions to users on the best mode of public transport. One of the first tech stacks the Chalo team developed was on live tracking - a monumentally challenging aspect of bus transport in India. This helps passengers plan their trips efficiently. The ETA algorithms provide passengers information on the bus route and time of arrival. Soon after, the team went on to introduce digital payments through the Chalo app, and more recently introduced the NFC-based touch-to-pay Chalo Card that works as an integrated solution for passengers to buy tickets, make payments or use a QR code to travel. For conductors, they provided PoS machines that had a long battery life, high transaction volume ability and structurally sound to withstand tough environments. The team essentially works with transport operators to integrate all elements - GPS tracking on the bus to software solutions on the cloud and mobile applications for the users, end-to-end. In addition to developing ETA algorithms, live tracking and extensive data-driven prediction engines, Chalo also introduced a Seat Availability Feature last year that would indicate how many seats the bus had during a trip. This was done after installing cameras onboard buses that helped provide data on seat availability and also enabled easier and accurate audits of bus journeys. A 1015 day pilot on a bus route was initiated which was a success. The team spends a considerable amount of time and effort to improvize on early version of its app. On average, there is a new version released with improvements every 2 weeks that saw additions such as emergency SOS, live trip sharing and multiple languages. At present, Chalo is present in 23 cities and works with many state transportation divisions such as WBTC Kolkata, DTC Delhi, KSRTC Kerela, TNSTC Tamil Nadu, ASTC Assam, AMTS Ahmedabad, KMRL Kochi and AICTSL Indore to name a few. Officials believe that the app will increase the dependency of commuters on the public transport system which may help in reducing the number of cars on road. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 50TAGHIVE: KEEPING STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS USING A CLICKER Problem Solution Impact It is a multi-stakeholder solution for it connects all parties on a single platform, also increasing accountability.

This self-learning system is highly scalable and can be easily integrated with other systems.03 04Abof (All About Fashion) is the online venture of the Aditya Birla Group, the third largest business conglomerate in India. The Aditya Birla group is established in the fashion retail segment with over 2000 brick  mortar stores. In July 2016 they acquired Forever 21 in India further consolidating their position in the Indian fashion retail market. Abof understood that to succeed in improving customers experiences, it required to focus on smart technology and digital innovation across all aspects of the online business. One of the key areas was the use of content curation technology. The companys stylists collected user generated content (UGC) and trends from social media and hand curated looks. This gave the online retailer good results but the solution was not scalable. Each week only a handful of products were available in the curated form. Abof tested various kinds of recommendations based on product attributes and color. These solutions ranged from meta tags to collaborative filtering. After doing A/B tests, Abof zeroed in on Streamoids image-based recommendations, as the solution enabled an increase in click through rates from 3.4 - 9 percent. Abof introduced Streamoids Outfitter, an AI-powered recommendation engine that created complete looks for every product in the inventory, in real-time. The recommendation engine was trained on Abofs styles, and was based on outfits modeled in the catalog and the internal style guide. The self-learning system learned about trends as well as the customer, hence, the recommendations were personalized.

To address the overall challenges Aquaconnect built AI models that analyzed the pond level data continuously such as the Morby-mass model, pond health monitoring model, healthcare management model, growth prediction model and feed optimization model. The team at Aquaconnect developed an AI-based app  FarmMOJO  that advised small scale shrimp farmers by tracking the farming practices and identifying any drawbacks that required attention. Aquaconnects mobile application FarmMOJO utilized Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advise farmers on their pond operations based on constant monitoring of water quality, feed intake, disease outbreak indicators, and biomass conversion (which indicates the efficiency of farm feeding strategy). The app leveraged machine learning technology to provide relevant insights to farmers and suggested appropriate advice for better productivity. The data intelligence capability connected farmers with industry players including food and produce processors, certification agencies, and feed and healthcare producers - this capability enabled the farmers to optimize their supply-chains and created a sustainable procurement process with traceable information. It also connected the farmers with financial institutions to enable crop insurance facilities.Aquaculture is the practice of breeding, raising, and harvesting fish, shrimps, shellfish, and aquatic plants. This practice could evolve into a viable commercial farming practice in India, with an export value of 5 - 7 billion. in 2018-2019, and an annual growth rate of 10-15 percent. However, the industry lacks the technology adoption and efficiency. Around 2 million rural farmers in coastal communities are involved in aquaculture - the farmers typically follow traditional farming practices, which prevents them from achieving production efficiency or predicting/preventing the spread of diseases. The shrimp farming industry comes with two main challenges  high production costs and disease outbreaks. Breeding of shrimps is usually carried out by these smallholder farmers who are not equipped with the latest technology or knowhow to farm shrimp. Furthermore, aqua farmers struggle to manage water quality and diseases, and most of the time are unable to make informed decisions during their daily operations. Lack of data is a critical challenge that the industry needs to address. Some other challenges include procuring good quality feed, ensuring regular healthcare inputs, and prompting prospective buyers to purchase the harvested catch. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 55Impact FarmMOJO is helping shrimp farmers in the optimization of feeding, disease prediction and control and water management. It ensures effective feed usage and biomass conversion in shrimp farming. The AI- powered farm advisor  FarmMOJO  helps the shrimp and fish farmers enhance their farm productivity and increase their farm income by 5 percent. Alongside, it also simplifies the farm operations and improves efficiency, predictability and transparency.The overall approach helped shrimp farmers improve disease prediction rates and accuracy, boost production efficiency, produce higher quality shrimps, increase profits and reduce dependency on external sources for daily operations. During the pilot, FarmMOJO predicted diseases across more than 120 ponds; and helped farmers take corrective actions and minimize the losses. Currently, FarmMOJO works with 3000 shrimp farmers from states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, however planning to expand its operations by adding 5800 ponds across India. Aquaconnect has partnered with IDH - Farmers In Transition (FIT) to advance its prediction and disease control in Indian shrimp farms. This partnership will support 350 hectares of aquaculture production in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. It has also associated itself with Solidaridads Sustainable Aquaculture Initiative in Odisha to provide data-driven shrimp farming advisory services to 2000 hectares. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 56CROPIN: AI-POWERED CLIMATE CHANGE AGRI- ADAPTABILITY PLATFORM FOR THE INDIAN FARMING COMMUNITY Problem Solution CropIn Technologies was selected as the Agtech partner in a public-private project with the Government of India and the World Bank for developing agriculture technology to build climate resilience. The project spanned an area of 1650 hectares. CropIn developed a holistic solution for the project in an effort to combat the effects of climate change. The overall solution covered 5 modules, of which 4 were relevant to the farmers:  SmartFarm was the farm management solution that enabled digitization of farms. This enabled quicker decision with the help of prescriptive, predictive, and descriptive data analytics. The module mapped and calculated farm data through geo-tagging and area auditing of the farm plot. The module also captured data on the seed varieties and crop stage information. The data was analyzed by the system and accurate measurements were carried out for the farmers - right from seed selection to harvest. This saved the farmers time and provided accurate data on the entire seed to harvest life cycle.  SmartRisk was an intelligence solution for agri-business leveraging agri-alternative data and provided risk mitigation and forecasting. A machine learning algorithm provided insights on weather data at the farm/ village and regional level.  mWarehouse enabled farm to fork traceability and compliance, quality control and flexible inventory management. While the solution was developed for food/agri processing and export companies, it benefited the farmers as well, as the farmers/producers had a birds-eye view of the end-use of their produce.  AcreSquare was a mobile application that enabled companies/cooperatives to directly interact with farmers - these organizations were able to reach out to farmers to educate, share content, and provide consultation. This enabled companies to build trust with the farmers, without the intervention of intermediaries. Adverse climate change is a threat to sustainable farming as it leads to soil degradation, drop in crop yield, and lower quality of produce; it also increases the attacks by pests and insects. As per an Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) report, a reduction to the extent of 9 percent in agriculture yields are expected in the medium term (2010-2039) because of climate change. This calls for swift adoption of climate resilient agriculture practices. Among the developing nations, India is one of the biggest agro-based economies in the world, where nearly 70 percent of rural households rely on it for their sustenance. Given that Indian farming is still dependent on weather and climate cycles for planting, irrigating, and harvesting crops, the problem of adverse climate change is all the more severe for the Indian farming community. There is an overwhelming need to utilize technology and smart farming solutions to build climate resilience for the Indian farmers. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 57Impact CropIns climate smart advisory module developed season-wise crop configurations for all the major crops. CropIn helped schedule and monitor farm activities to implement complete traceability of the produce/ harvest. Seven-day weather forecasts were derived from the best available weather observation systems and forecast models, and provided to the farmers. CropIn helped educate farmers on adoption of the right package of practices and inputs. CropIn helped devise systems for monitoring crop health and harvest estimation. The project empowered farmers to adopt climate resilient practices and adapt to the climatic changes and unpredictability. As a result of the project, 12,000 plots were digitized. Approximately 8300 farmers impacted, with an adoption rate of 90 per cnet. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 58CREDITVIDYA: AI-POWERED INCOME ASSESSMENT SOLUTION FOR NON-BANKING FINANCE CORPORATION (NBFC) Problem Accurate assessment of income is critical a step to approve and disburse a loan. This process plays an important role in determining the ability to repay, which is critical for underwriting unsecured loans. Lenders typically have two methods for determining the income of a loan applicant:  Physical Verification - Physical verification through bank statements and other supporting documents. This is a cost-intensive process, and requires numerous follow-ups with the customer. In most cases, the customer withdraws the application because of the amount of time taken and the number of documents required for verifications. This leads to high drop-offs.  Bank Statement Extraction - Tools for this purpose, such as Statement Scrapers, are available for barely 10 percent of the population. The accuracy is low and the results are not real-time. In most cases, customers are required to provide their bank ID and password so that the lender can access their statement records - this leads to customers withdrawing from the process altogether. A leading NBFC was using a bank statement extraction to determine the income of potential borrowers. This process was cumbersome and time consuming for the NBFC causing a long delay in loan disbursal. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 59Solution Impact CreditVidya was onboarded to provide a solution to determine the income of the borrower. Its tool IncomeX has revolutionized the process of income determination for lenders. Unlike scraping tools, IncomeX is based on the extraction of alternative data to which a deep neural net model is applied. Embedded in the app of the lender, the algorithm identifies an individuals income with 90 percent accuracy. The product has two components:  TrueSalary: This system accurately identifies the income of the individual  Income group behavior: This system places the individual within a likely income band, with 90 percent accuracy, when the data is insufficient to predict the exact income IncomeX enabled the lender to assess the incomes of 8 times more users compared with the existing bank statement scraping tool. Once the solution was implemented, there was no need for uploading documents or physical verification. The Turn-Around-Time (TAT) for determining the income of the loan applicant was reduced from over 24 hours to under 1 minute. The implementation of IncomeX enabled the lender to assess the income for about 8-times more users as compared with the time and resources taken for the existing bank statement scraping tool. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 60ARYA.AI: AUTOMATED INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SOLUTION FOR INSURANCE PROVIDERS Problem Solution Impact To address this problem, Arya.ai utilized a predictive system - Libra - that was powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Arya.ai has pioneered the use of AI/ML in financial services - Aryas Insurance Stack  Libra has been developed specifically to automate the key functions in the Insurance sector. Libra provided an autonomous AI product stack for insurance companies to automate the key business functions. The system was trained with specific data from insurers and customized as per the needs of the business.Insurers have multiple data and information sources for any product, service or customer. These sources needs to be carefully analyzed before applying the data for any policy or claim. Moreover, this analysis needs to be carried out across all stages of the insurance service - Distribution, Risk Selection, Underwriting, Policy Servicing, Claim Intimation, Claim Admissibility, Claim Adjudication and Settlement, Fraud Prevention and Monitoring. Insurance service providers have, so far, been utilizing rule-based systems and manual interventions to carry out this analysis. But, with the increase in the number of customers, types of customers and insurance products, claims, and even fraud cases, the data and data types have exponentially increased - the analysis of this data has become a cumbersome task for all insurance service providers. Even with digitization, the problem has not been mitigated, and the amount of manual intervention has doubled over the years. Post the implementation of the solution, there was increase in efficiencies in the underwriting and claims management processes - efficiencies increased by 50 percent to 70 percent respectively. There was improvement in customer turnaround times. Decisions, by the system, were taken in less than a second - this improved the level of satisfaction of the customer and the sales channels. The process of decision making was standardized. In a manual system, the judgment and analysis would differ across experienced underwriters and claim managers, and novice underwriters and claim managers. The modules provided complete uniformity in decision-making, thereby improving sales confidence and customer delight. Over a period of time, the insurance service providers portfolio improved. The service provider plans to partner with Arya.ai to extend the product modules to cover upstream and downstream processes - this would bring all the aspects of the insurance companys business and operations under the AI/ML Libra solution. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 61CULTYV ATE: DEVELOPMENT OF A SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM BY CULTYV ATE FOR INDIAN FARMERS Problem Improper crop watering and nutrition management are two primary causes of poor harvest quality. In India, the cultivation of 70  80 percent of the crops is reliant on rain or flood irrigation. To get the optimum yield, a farmer typically considers 10-12 parameters before reaching a decision on the precise watering and nutrient management schedule. The excessive reliance on seasonal/climatic water supply results in a low yield during periods of lower rainfall. This increases the probability of a bad harvest coupled with pest infestation and disease. Any shortfall in the harvest yield causes a loss of revenue to the farming community. For example, sugarcane - a crop heavily reliant on regular irrigation and water supply. Traditionally, an estimated quantity of 22 million liters of water per acre per year needs to be supplied through flood irrigation to yield a successful sugarcane harvest of an average yield of 40-45 tons per acre. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 62Solution CultYvates Smart Irrigation System leveraged IoT, Predictive Analytics, and AI to calculate the precise amount of water required for crops. The system utilized 2 types of parameters to provide automated irrigation solutions: Impact The system calculated the soil moisture to decide the optimum water requirement - this saved time and precious water and human resources, and maximized the crop yield. The systems advanced sensors and technologies kept track of water usage and saved large quantities of water. Farmers were able to check the ground level data on their smartphones to monitor and assess the watering of the crops. The smart farming technology kept the farmers updated through the various stages of growth of the crops. With the implementation of CultYvates Smart Irrigation System, the water consumption for sugarcane farms was reduced by approximately 50 percent, while the yield increased by 100 percent. The farmers were able to grow close to 105 tons of sugarcane per acre by utilizing only 12 million litres of water per acre per year. The system was also suitable for such crops as grapes and pomegranate - crops that require precise watering - that varies depending on the season and soil type. Static parameters, such as crop type and soil type Dynamic data points, such as crop age, amount of water irrigated in previous seasons, wind speed, and the amount of sunlight, among others Once the data was collected, a complex algorithm analyzed the data to identify the optimum water to be supplied to the farm/crop. The water supply was managed by regulating the power supply voltage - the power supply adjusted the water flow to the farm/crop. This ensured the ideal amount of water to be supplied for the crop. CultYvates system leveraged a combination of electrical systems, which included soil sensors, flow meters and valves. The data from these systems was combined with satellite data to identify the precise watering schedule. Wireless and battery-operated controllers were utilized to run the electrical system even without regular electricity/ power - this ensured that there was seamless transmission of data to the cloud. The AI engine was developed after analyzing data from millions of similar use cases. Data from the use cases was used to develop specific and customized automation controls. The machine learning algorithms constantly analyzed the data from the farms. After the implementation of CultYvates smart irrigation system, farmers received soil moisture alerts on their smartphones. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 63INTELLO LABS: DEVELOPMENT OF AN AI SOLUTION TO ASSAY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS Problem Solution Impact To address this issue, Intello Labs, an agri-tech start-up, developed an AI-based platform to grade and monitor the quality of agricultural commodities. The platform utilized computer vision and deep learning technologies. Intello Labs provided an image-based solution that delivered results on a smartphone app. This brought transparency and standardization to the process of quality assessment and reduced the risk associated with the long agriculture supply chain. Through an image taken from the smartphone of the agri-product, the application tested, analyzed, and graded the visual quality parameters of the product. The farmers could upload the picture of their yield directly onto Intellos system through the mobile app. The advanced algorithms would examine the photo of the commodity and provide a rating based on a set of USDA approved criteria, including color, size, and visual defects. With the algorithmic rating in place, each party in the value chain was aware of the quality of the commodity on sale, and could accordingly set the prices. The platform and corresponding results were hosted on the National Agriculture Market or eNAM - the online trading platform for agricultural commodities in India.Quality assaying is a crucial aspect of the agricultural supply chain. This step has traditionally been performed manually. As a consequence, the results have been subjective, time-consuming, and open to malpractices. The fruits and vegetable wholesalers and retailers across Mandis required an easy-to-use, scalable, and reliable assaying system that could be implemented at all National Mandis. While labs and even semi-portable machines were alternatives to the manual process of quality assessment, these solutions are expensive and have limited capacity. This was the reason that the Mandi Associations were looking for a viable quality assessment solution that provided results in a digital format. The app caters to all members in the agri supply chain, including growers, packers, aggregators, exporters, foodservice, and retailers. In 2019-2020, the app offered services for testing and grading wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and cardamom. Six or seven more commodities are scheduled to be added to the assaying portfolio, including coffee, tea, and grapes. The solution has reduced the testing time of the quality of the agri-product from 15 minutes to 2 minutes, with an accuracy rate of more than 95 percent. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 64DECIMAL TECHNOLOGIES: AI-DRIVEN LEAD MANAGEMENT SOLUTION FOR INDUSIND BANK Problem Solution Impact Decimal Technologies, a fintech startup, offering various mobile-based applications for business requirements, developed an AI-driven lead management and activity management platform.

To increase customer satisfaction and RoI across digital channels, the Branch Banking Heads (BBH) monitored the performance of branches within their allocated region. This process started with the Branch Managers receiving a branch performance report. The reports contained large volumes of data, tables, and charts to indicate the performance of products, channels, and branches. The Branch Managers were required to manually analyze the numbers, compare it with monthly allotted targets, and interpret the data to share with their respective Cluster Heads. The Cluster Heads followed the same process of manually collating the branch performance reports into one comprehensive report. This was presented to the Circle Heads. This process was mirrored and followed right up to the Branch Banking Heads. This system of report creation and analyzing data was time-consuming and inefficient. The managers at various levels spent hours collating data, interpreting insights, and creating personalized reports for the next in-line manager. The manual effort substantially slowed down efforts in core banking operations and overall deliveries. Overall, HDFC Bank identified 4 issues with this process:  Cumbersome manual data extraction for report creation  Lack of personalized reports across branches  Branch employees spending too much time analyzing and interpreting the data  Branch Banking Heads unable to perform a quick analysis of sales performance 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 66Solution Impact To address the reporting deficiencies, vPhrase, a pioneer in Reporting Automation and Business Intelligence, implemented Phrazor, a Natural Language Generation (NLG) platform for HDFC Bank.

It procures or manufactures the furniture, and delivers the furniture to locations within India. Initially, Urban Ladder used a manual process for planning the logistics and delivery. The delivery agents were given a list of orders on paper and they were expected to decide which optimum route would enable the fastest deliveries. The company and the logistics providers faced problems related to load balancing and assessing which vehicle should be utilized for which orders - this manual process was carried out to meet delivery promises made to customers within the promised delivery and installation time. The manual process was cumbersome and time consuming. Moreover, there was no possible way for the company to keep track of the delivery agents except through mobile phones. The manual shipment process significantly increased error rates, processing times, human resource costs, and additional overhead costs. The manual delivery process was unable to efficiently solve the issues related to variability in the product volumes and multiple customer delivery points. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 68Solution Impact Locus AI enabled Urban Ladder to automate the logistics operations and optimize last-mile delivery costs, improve delivery performance and most importantly, enhance customer satisfaction levels.

The sale of tobacco leaves to domestic and international customers (cigarette manufacturers) is a major revenue stream for ITCs ABD. Each customer has specific requirements for leaf tobacco - these requirements are achieved by blending different kinds of leaves together. As tobacco is an agri-produce, there are massive variations found in the leaves year-on-year. Customers placed sales orders against specific tobacco grades. The grades required by the customers were based on specific parameters, such as color, ripeness, size, and texture, to name a few. Thereafter, every order of tobacco placed by a particular customer had to comply with the customers initial grade requirements. Customers expected consistent product grades with every sale, which made the blending process critical. Hence, before a given sale, it was important that the grades (packaged in tobacco cases) were inspected for compliance with the customers requirements. The manual process of grading was time-consuming and highly subjective. Personnel deployed for the manual process were expert graders, and managed to inspect only 10 percent of the total number of tobacco cases at the processing plant. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 70Solution Impact The solution enabled the maintenance of product quality by minimizing manual involvement in the inspection process. The solution significantly reduced costs by reducing the personnel time taken during the daily inspection process with 1 to 2 manual graders per-line. The solution enhanced efficiency by grading 100 percent of the tobacco leaves instead of the 10 percent carried out in the manual process. The solution made the real time inspection of all 100 percent tobacco (leaves) cases.A robust quality check and AI/Computer Vision (CV) system was required to ensure that the tobacco cases processed were physically compliant (in terms of identified parameters to grade tobacco) with the customers approved tobacco grades. For this purpose, Constems AI (CAI) developed a base level machine learning model. This was carried out by utilizing a data set of more than 1500 images of tobacco (leaves) grades. Constems AI-based packaged tobacco inspection system, consisted of three modules:  CAIs core module - the AI grading application  CAI-UIs software module - user interface  CAI-reporting system - a reporting module for the ITC project management team - this system generated the analytics for the inspection. The reporting module also provided other predictive results for strategic planning The system had a high-definition camera, which was custom-designed and mounted with a pneumatic arm on each of the production lines. This was operated in-sync with the tobacco-case production and inspection cycles. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 71TARTAN SENSE: WEED REMOVING ROBOT FOR INDIAN FARMERS Problem Weeds are harmful to crops and farming in general. Weeds compete with the desired crops for the resources that the crop typically needs, including direct sunlight, soil nutrients, water, and space for growth. Hence, the growth of these undesirable plants in a field diminishes the yield as well as the quality of crops. According to a study published by the International Journal of Weed Biology, the crop losses caused by weeds are the highest at about 32 percent - higher than pests, 18 percent, and pathogens, 15 percent. Farmers, therefore, need to spend a lot of time and money on regularly removing weeds (weeding) or spraying weedicides. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 72Solution Impact Bengaluru-based agritech startup, TartanSense, developed a small, land-based robot rover to carry out weeding and pest control. The solution was deployed as pilots across many states, including Karnataka. It has also been provided to agri co-operatives and large farming/agri companies. The robot, named Brijbot, moved in the farm, identified weeds, and sprayed the targeted weed with weedicides and pesticides. The functionality of the system utilized several AI and Autonomous technologies:  The rover autonomously traveled across the fields with a downward facing camera mounted on it.  The AI/ML system identified the weeds using Computer Vision.  The system was trained with images of both crops and weeds, so it could automatically differentiate between the two groups.  Once the weed was identified, the robot automatically sprays weedicide and pesticide on the plant, through a precision sprays system.  Brijbot sprays the chemical only on the detected weeds. The product has been designed to move around narrow Indian farms for long hours. The rover is also equipped to gather land-based data (including crop health and soil quality) and generates reports with actionable insights for the farmer. TartanSense offers the robot as a subscription service to farmers as opposed to a direct sale. During the pilots, Brijbot carried out weeding for eight hours a day with zero manual intervention or monitoring. The weedicide/pesticide was sprayed with a precision of about 3 cm, this reduced the usage of chemicals by 50 to 70 percent - reducing costs and protecting the crops. The robot removed weeds for an entire acre in an hour; alternatives take at least half-a-day per acre - the robot thus increases weeding efficiency by 700 percent. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 73ARTIV ATIC: AI UNDERWRITING PLATFORM FOR LIFE INSURANCE SERVICE PROVIDERS Problem Life insurance companies are regulated by IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) in India. Moreover, life insurance companies utilize legacy processes, systems, and risk assessment models, along with rule-based outcomes. These outdated processes and systems increased the challenges for the particular life insurance company - as the redundant processes caused a loss in customer confidence and revenues. Additional detrimental impacts of the legacy systems included increase in risk  fraud and longer processing times for claims and refunds. Lack of data insights was a significant barrier for the data-driven risk, profiling, and decisions of the insurance service provider - and was impacting the underwriting process of the insurance provider. Moreover, the rule-based system was not adequate or smart enough to tackle changing customer data, regulatory compliance, customer behaviour, competitive environment, and overall customer needs. Overall, outdated systems and processes resulted in poor product planning and creation, and detrimental customer benefits. More than 70 percent of the operations of the insurance provider were manually run - this led to errors, poor experience, and increase in labor costs. Overall, the Life Insurer was facing the following challenges in the manual process: a turnaround time of more than 2 days, less than 20 percent data-driven insights - moreover the manual insights process was error-prone, a manual system with no dynamic scoring and no risk profiling. The insurance provider wanted to replace its manual and legacy process with an ML-based dynamic decision system. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 74Solution Impact The Life Insurance Provider wanted to improve the complex underwriting process both for medical and financial underwriting. The insurance company sought the services of Artivatic for this purpose - Artivatic implemented AUSIS (AI Underwriting Platform) for the Life Insurance provider to transform the complex underwriting journey to a simple, automated, and real-time process. Artivatic provided an end-to-end automation solution to understand the customers from a 360-degree perspective. The automation solution utilized third party, government, device, and other data points to build a 360-degree risk scoring, fraud and decision system. The solution provided a customer credibility score to instantly assess the customers viability. The solution utilized dynamic ML-based learning and self-reliant rule-based engines to perform the complex processes. The solution predicted financial and health risk and provided insights on fraud to better assess the premium, benefits, and cover for the insurance customers. The automation was enabled by STP (Straight-through Processing) that carried out most of the manual transactions in one pass. Straight-Through Processing (STP) is a mechanism that automates the end-to-end processing of transactions of various financial instruments. It involves the use of a single system to process or control all elements of the work-flow of a financial transaction, including Front, Middle, and Back office, and General Ledger operations. STP can be defined as electronically capturing and processing transactions in one pass, from the point of first deal to final settlement. The automated underwriting through STP for underwriters assisted the insurance company to cut-down the policy issuance time. The seamless and real-time underwriting decision system processed policies in less than 180 seconds. The solution provided real-time scoring and decision making from multiple data points.

The startup developed the worlds largest digital agriculture e-Marketplace. The decentralized blockchain network, Agri10x, provided a secure data platform and prevented the possibility of any price manipulation. Initially, farmers from the state of Maharashtra were on-boarded to the platform. The platform had in-built AI programs, and had such features as instant payment, quality assaying, competitive pricing, and storage and logistics support for farmers. The platforms in-built AI engine analyzed the data on the differential price of produce/commodity - the prices were procured from over 250 APIs. The platform then arrived at a set of maximum and minimum prices for that commodity. This was carried out through several algorithms, which took inputs from multiple factors. These factors included quality, transport costs, demand-supply trends, and commodity prices, among others. The entire suite of technologies was developed on a consensus-driven blockchain network. By utilizing NLP tools, the startup removed the communication gaps between the farmers and the traders.In the agriculture sector, middlemen or traders often do not provide farmers with the optimum price for the harvest. Traders typically charge a 30-60 percent fee on the produce (agriculture commodity or harvest). After the produce is supplied to the trader, the farmers face a relatively long and protracted payment cycle - typical pay-out transactions take 45-60 days to fulfil. To shorten the transaction time and reduce the reliance on traders, a platform was required to bring farmers directly in touch with the buyers. Farmers who were on-boarded to the platform, traded directly with the buyers eliminating the need for the middlemen. Immediately after the sale was carried out, the respective farmer received a digital payment. Conventionally, there is 45-60 days wait period for farmers to receive the payment from the trader. However, the blockchain system ensured immediate disbursement of funds. Agri10x takes a 6 percent share from every transaction compared to the 30-60 percent commission that middlemen usually charge. The platform or marketplace connected farmers with buyers both in domestic and international markets. Agri10x thus assisted farmers to export commodities to various Southeast Asian and Middle East countries. Since its launch, the platform has expanded beyond Maharashtra to pan-India, specifically to states such as Bihar, UP , Jharkhand, Karnataka and Tripura, to name a few. To spread awareness of this initiative, Agri10x has built an influencer campaign and called these farmers as influencers or Village Entrepreneurs. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 79 ACADEMIA 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 80IIIT HYDERABAD: USING ML TO CREATE MORTALITY PREDICTION MODEL FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS Problem Solution Impact Researchers from Centre for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics (CCNSB) at IIIT Hyderabad have developed an ML model for risk and mortality prediction of COVID-19 patients. A powerful combination of five features: age, neutrophils, lymphocytes, LDH, and hs-CRP , has helped to predict mortality with 96 percent accuracy. In their study titled Machine learning based clinical decision support system for early COVID-19 mortality prediction, the researchers have attempted to provide a mortality prediction as early as 16 days before the outcome. The outcome in this case is described as discharge from hospital or death. Various ML models (neural networks, logistic regression, XGBoost, random forests, SVM, and decision trees) have been trained and performance compared to determine the model that achieves consistently high accuracy across the days that span the disease. The best performing method using XGBoost feature importance and neural network classification, predicts with an accuracy of 90 percent as early as 16 days before the outcome. Robust testing with three cases based on days to outcome confirms the strong predictive performance and practicality of the proposed model. A detailed analysis and identification of trends was performed using these key biomarkers to provide useful insights for intuitive application.The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on the healthcare systems around the globe. In these times, it is crucial to assess risk so that critical resources can be mobilised to treat patients progressing to severe stages. Focused medical treatments can be administered only when there is a clear understanding of the risk factors that influence mortality the most. Therefore, it has become imperative to know early on in the diagnosis about the progression of the disease. Machine learning methods are capable of discerning useful patterns in large dimensional data that is expected to aid in the decision-making process of identifying, with high accuracy, patients who are at high risk. This study provide solutions that would help accelerate the decision-making process in healthcare systems for focussed medical treatments in an accurate, early, and reliable manner. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 81W ADHW ANI AI: AI-BASED EARLY W ARNING PEST SYSTEM FOR THE INDIAN COTTON FARMING COMMUNITY Problem Solution Impact Farmers from Maharashtra needed to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) to fill this critical gap. Wadhwani AI or Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Mumbai-based independent and non-profit research institute, developed an AI-based pest management platform that could be easily deployed on the smartphones of farmers/ field workers. After the field workers uploaded necessary images of the crops, the images passed through a multi-task network that accredited the image. The advanced AI algorithm and image classification models then classified and counted the pests based on the photos and suggested ways to tackle the problem. Using features generated from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the AI system detected and counted the number of pests. Using this count, along with the help of guidelines set by entomologists, the AI system recommended appropriate actions to the farmers - which included whether or not to use pesticides on the crops. In terms of output yield, cotton is Indias third-largest crop after rice and wheat. Typically, 75 percent of the crop is grown by small holder farmers. One of the critical challenges the farmers face is managing pests despite the heavy use of pesticides and pheromone traps to catch pests. In the past, thousands of farmers from the state of Maharashtra, especially from the Amravati district, have had to flatten/destroy their entire cotton crop because of crop damage caused by the pink bollworm pest. Even after farmers switched to the genetically modified BT Cotton, which is resistant to pests, the problem persisted. Farmers were struggling with the lack of timely intervention and the shortage of expertise to handle such a situation. Typically, farmers depend on the Government workers who manually examine the pests and relay the data to various departments for research and action. However, considering these field workers are typically not equipped with the appropriate technology to identify pests affecting the crop, the manually collected data has, so far, not been accurate. Moreover, the time taken to analyze the data and send recommendations back to the farmers is too long and any incidence of pests destroys the crop during the delay of information and action. The AI-based system was piloted in partnership with the Better Cotton Initiative and the Maharashtra Government. The system is currently deployed in the districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Telangana, with over 18000 farmers utilizing the application. Post the implementation of the AI-based system, the farmers observed a 25 percent gain in the yield of the cotton crop. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 82IIT KHARAGPUR: AI-BASED PREDICTION MODEL FOR DETECTING ARSENIC IN INDIA S DRINKING W ATER Problem Solution Impact In a breakthrough, a first of its kind, researchers from IIT Kharagpur have successfully predicted the distribution of groundwater arsenic and human health risk in the affected areas, using AI algorithms on environmental and geological and human usage parameters. The researchers have delineated the high and low arsenic zones across the entire delta using AI and quantify the number of people exposed. They have developed probabilistic models of arsenic occurrence, exposure and human health risk assessment within the delta region. The model shows a strong association of surficial aquitard thickness and groundwater-fed irrigation to regional-scale As-hazard.Arsenic has been a menace in Eastern India especially along the banks of the Ganga for almost two decades now, putting millions of people at severe health risk. Researchers have been studying the distribution patterns of the contaminated groundwater for years to develop a large-scale ecological and environmental framework addressing this challenge in the region. The studies conducted until now were unable to offer an effective model for policy decisions due to the delineation of the local extent and geochemical mechanisms for arsenic pollution. The researchers from IIT Kharagpur, thus opted for AI which is now being used across the world to successfully model the distribution of groundwater contaminants. While the predictive model framework would prove to be vital typically for the identification of drinking water sources in arsenic affected areas of West Bengal, it can be used in other parts of the country which are also suffering from severe groundwater pollutants. The outcome of this study provides the information for the location of safe groundwater, which is the primary source of drinking water for most of India. Eventually, all this information forms the baseline knowledge for the recently initiated Jal Jeevan Mission of the Government of India which aims to provide safe drinking water to every household of the country by 2024. Such successful use of AI in geoscience enables us to find answers and build prima-facie understanding before undertaking further field-based investigation or validation. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 83IISC: RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF COVID-19 BIOMARKERS IN BLOOD PLASMA USING RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY AND AI Problem Solution Impact This particular experiment is aimed at identifying COVID-19 biomarkers in the blood plasma of infected patients. Along with the power of machine learning, it will be possible to identify patterns from large datasets more effectively. Raman spectroscopy is an analytical technique where scattered light is used to measure the vibrational energy modes of a sample. It can provide chemical and structural information, as well as the identification of substances through their characteristic Raman fingerprint. Raman spectroscopy extracts this information through the detection of Raman scattering from the sample. This method was devised by physicist CV Raman and his research partner KS Krishnan in 1928. IISc has teamed up with AIIMS, Bhopal, who will be providing patient samples and healthy controls. With machine learning aided by multi-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), large datasets can be analyzed in a matter of seconds.Given the rapid pace at which the COVID-19 pandemic has been creating havoc, it is important to develop new technologies that can rapidly detect COVID-19 and perform mass testing at an affordable price. In this regard, Raman spectroscopy holds considerable promise as it has found numerous applications in disease diagnosis. Every disease is associated with a change in biochemistry which can either be a cause for disease manifestation or may be a consequence of the disease itself. With gaps existing in the prevalent testing methods, researchers at IISc and AIIMS Bhopal are hopeful that their novel method of detecting COVID-19 biomarkers through Raman spectroscopy and AI will become more widely adopted and standardized. Newer forms of AI are finding greater use in science, especially biomedical data analysis. So far, scientists have been able to analyze bacteria and sepsis, so analyzing a virus seemed like a natural extension of this branch of investigation. It is well known that several challenges exist with the efficacy of RT-PCR and RAT. Therefore, the researchers aim to bring about more accuracy in mass testing for COVID-19 through this method. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 84IIIT DELHI: REPURPOSING EXISTING DRUGS TO TREAT COVID-19 USING AI Problem Solution Impact The first step is of Drug Target Interaction (DTI) prediction, which is a standard approach where AI models can compute the similarity between chemical structures of the selected drug and the similarity between the genomic structures of viruses including the coronavirus. As a next step, the model then scrutinizes the historical information on the efficacy of the drug on different viruses and selects the drug that has been successful in treating viruses whose genomic structure is similar to coronavirus. As the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying, it has become imperative to develop innovative ways to help the overburdened medical fraternity in treating COVID-19 patients efficiently and effectively. Along with global researchers, Indias AI researchers are also building novel solutions to fight the pandemic. To treat covid patients, IIIT Delhi has been working on computational AI model for drug repositioning. The beauty of drug repositioning is that instead of manually going through drugs to check its effectiveness against the disease, AI algorithms can speed things up with high accuracy. Some well-known examples of drug repositioning are Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Dexamethasone and Remdesivir. IIIT Delhi plans to scrutinize more than 100 listed antiviral drugs and prune it to 5-10 drugs that have the best chance of succeeding. So far, the model has selected drugs like Remdesivir, Umifenovir, Ribavirin and Sofosbuvir. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 85IIT MADRAS: AI4BHARAT- INDIAN LANGUAGE NLP INITIAITVE AND AI Problem Solution Impact AI4Bharat is a non-profit, open-source community of engineers, domain experts, policy makers and academicians, all collaborating to build AI-solutions for solving Indias critical socio-economic and environmental challenges. It is helmed by IIT Madras faculty members Mitesh Khapra and Pratyush Kumar, who aim to improve the digital experience for Indias millions of users who access the web in vernacular languages but are challenged by the extremely low availability of information. As a result of their efforts, they were able to release the largest corpus of Indian language texts and increase the size of corpus available by an order of magnitude in many languages. They are creatively collecting data from different places, and then, building and releasing translation models in Indian languages. Further on, theyre focusing on the transliteration problem, which involves typing in a regional language using an English keyboard, by swapping text in predictive ways. The goal of this initiative is to bring parity in AI-technology for Indian languages with English. Language technology holds special relevance in a culturally diverse country like India that has a variety of languages and dialects spoken in its various corners. Through allied abilities such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition, it gives machines the ability to comprehend and respond to human texts and speech. Even though the proliferation of mobile devices is intense in the country, the availability of digital information in regional languages in extremely limited, if not entirely negligible. Therefore, innovations in the field have the potential of impacting the lives of billions who still interact primarily in their vernacular language. AI4Bharat was part of Google Indias first AI For Social Good cohort, where the team worked with the NGO Pratham Books. Recently, theyve worked with the Nandan Nilekani-backed EkStep Foundation. Further, theyve launched a year-long AI residency program to mentor students who have completed their B-Tech. Theyre also in talks with the Government with regard to the National Language Translation Mission which was announced in this years budget. The team at AI4Bharat wants to keep all their models open source with permissible licenses so as to support startups, governments, or companies using these models. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 86DETECTD: NAGPUR-BASED STUDENTS ARE FIGHTING DEEPFAKES WITH AI Problem Solution Impact Detecting deepfakes used to be a very challenging task for individuals because it requires expertise in the AI domain. But they have created this platform where the user can simply visit the website, upload a media file from his local system, whether a photograph or a video, and the video is passed through our state of the art model. The media is then analysed for AI forgery to find out whether the video is fake or not, and the results are returned to the user within minutes.In the digital age, information spreads fast but misinformation spreads like wildfire. The ease of communication has enabled the rapid transmission of fake news, and the phenomenon has become so prevalent that its taken on proportions of a pandemic  an information pandemic  or infodemic. The problem escalates manifold when the medium of misinformation is video  something so compelling and seemingly true that even the smartest and most skeptical of minds could be taken for a ride. Known as deepfakes, these are AI-generated videos showing real people doing and saying fictional things. General Adversarial Networks (GANs) are commonly used to generate deepfakes. A major issue with most of the deepfake detecting solutions that are presently available in the market is their unreliability and the slow pace at which results are given. Detectd currently has an accuracy of 96 percent and is the first of its kind in India and amongst very few available globally and at present it can provide results from as low as 3-minutes. Last year Detectd emerged as the World Finalists and India Champions in Microsoft Imagine Cup 2021. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 87IIIT-DELHI: AI RESEARCHERS WORK TO SAVE TIGER POPULATION Problem Solution Impact It was in 2016, when Ankita Shukla was in her second year of PhD at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, under the supervision of Dr. Saket Anand, she was offered to work on the tiger project with WII. The idea was to leverage computer vision for solving a real world problem. They started by getting a lot of tiger images on camera traps. The first step to identifying tigers was the detection of different species. This species classification is a pre-processing step to even the tiger identification problem because they need to separate out the tiger images from rest of the species first. The task of the AI system that they devised was to identify the species present in a given a set of images.The National Tiger Conservation Authority in collaboration with the State Forest Departments, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and conservation partners conducts a national assessment for the Status of Tigers, Co- predators, Prey and their Habitat once in every four years. The aim of this exercise is to gauge the success of conservation efforts and to keep track of tiger populations and their ecosystems. What had until recently been a manual process of counting the individual tigers in the forests has now sought to be automated with the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The image processing software known as CaTRAT (Camera Trap Data Repository and Analysis Tool) is currently being used by WII for geotagging, coding and segregating the images to individual species folders. The geo-tagged images are scrutinized for potential software misclassification. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 88IISC: USING MATH  ML TO PREDICT THE TRAJECTORY OF COVID-19 Problem Solution Impact Upon being roped in by a member of the Karnataka COVID-19 taskforce, Prof. Sashikumaar Ganesan and Prof. Deepak Subramani of the Department of Computational Data Science, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) built a partial differential equation model that aims to predict the trajectory of COVID-19 across Indian states. The model provides mathematical insights on projected infection numbers should states go into lockdowns that are either 15 days, 21 days or 30 days in duration. The primary use of epidemiological models is mainly for hindsight analysis. This is what spurred the development of their model, and they wanted to use this data to eventually help predict how the ongoing COVID-19 crisis would evolve.As the world continues to battle the pandemic, with some nations disproportionately affected, timely decisions based on mathematical deductions and AI-based models are the need of the hour. In order to help the policymakers understand virus behaviours and make data-driven decisions and interventions, Prof. Sashikumaar Ganesan and Prof. Deepak Subramani from the Indian Institute of Science are providing Karnatakas Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) with results derived from mathematical modelling of COVID-19 that projects how the disease will move through the population and how effective lockdowns can be. This model helps policymakers stay ahead of a crisis. With data analysis and machine learning, it is possible to closely track a diseases trajectory in the population. Mathematical models must be used to understand the scenario that lays ahead. It points policymakers in the right direction and tells them where to look more closely. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 89IIT BOMBAY: AI MODEL FOR DIAGNOSIS OF TWO SPECIES OF MALARIA PARASITES Problem Solution Impact The researchers collected blood samples for strains of P falciparum, P vivax and dengue from across the country - Medical College Hospital, Kolkata, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner and Dr. LH Hiranandani Hospital, Mumbai, respectively, along with blood samples of healthy people, for creating a dataset for the training of the AI model. The dataset was analyzed and the researchers studied the protein levels from blood plasma against the severity of malaria to create quantifiable data.Putting and end to malaria remains a top government priority in India. In 2016, India introduced its first National Framework for Malaria Elimination (2016-2030). In 2019, the Government of India increased funding by more than 25 percent for the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. Currently, malaria diagnosis is undertaken by manually studying the blood samples for the parasites which still has difficulty in determining the progress of the disease. Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) have recently developed proteomics technologies and made artificial intelligence-based model in collaboration with three different hospitals across India. The model differentiates between two malaria parasites  P falciparum and P vivax for better malaria diagnosis. In malaria season, the number of cases is high, resulting in an increased burden on clinicians for manual diagnosis. Hence, if the diagnosis along with timely progression prediction from non-severe malaria to severe condition before the development of clinical manifestations is made for clinicians, then the treatment can be specific and efficient. Currently, the team is focused on creating a prototype of a diagnostic kit so that the technology is available to mass-detection of the disease. The project has been funded by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 90IIT KHARAGPUR: AUTOMATED READING OF LEGAL CASE JUDGEMENTS Problem Solution Impact One project that Dr. Ghoshs team is working on is the automated reading of case documents to save time of the legal practitioners. Another project is the automatic summarization of legal documents. Once they take a summary written by an expert and the summary generated by an algorithm, and then match the two. That gives a score in the range of 0-1. One means exact match and zero means no match at all. The methods that they have tried give the score of the range 0.5-0.6. In India, the bigger case documents are really long, running into hundreds of pages of paragraph after paragraph. Most of the work in the field of legal AI is done in Europe, China or US, but very few people in India work on it. IIT Kharagpur has one distinct advantage that it is possibly the only top engineering Institute with its own law school. Dr. Saptarshi Ghosh from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur took up the project. There are some indisputable benefits that AI can bring to the legal field. One advantage is speed. The things that take a week for a human to do may be done by AI five to ten minutes. So, if the more mundane jobs can be pushed to AI, then the law experts can actually focus on legal questions. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 91IIT HYDERABAD: COVID-19 TEST KIT Problem Solution Impact The scientists from the IIT, Hyderabad, Telangana have developed COVIHOME, an AI-powered COVID-19 test that allows self-testing at home. Since this is a self-testing kit, there is no need for expert supervision for an RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction), or a BSL 2 lab facility for the extraction of RNA. The kit is able to give a result in half an hour for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The COVID-19 virus is wreaking havoc across the country. An objective of the research team from IIT Hyderaad behind developing the self-testing kit was to break the transmission chain through affordable testing. While the kit is yet to be commercialized, once it will receive ICMR approvals, the product will be available at a reasonable rate of Rs. 300 in the market. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Researchs Centre for Cellular  Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB) has undertaken tests for the products validation independently with the in-house samples and hospital samples as advised by ICMR. The results have been impressive so far - the kits efficiency is at 94.2 percent, Sensitivity is at 91.3 percent and Specificity is at 98.2 percent. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 92IIT ROP AR: DEEPFAKE DETECTION IN LIVE VIDEOS Problem Solution Impact The Indian Institute of Technology in Ropar, Punjab has developed FakeBuster, a deepfake detector to identify and prevent imposters from attending video conferencing and manipulated faces on social media. It is a deep learning-based solution that helps detect if a video is manipulated or spoofed during a video- conference meeting. It has been tested for its effectiveness on popular web conferencing applications - Skype and Zoom and also detecting deepfakes where faces are manipulated on social media to spread misinformation or defame persons. FakeBuster can function online and offline. It uses a 3D convolutional neural network for predicting video segment-wise fakeness scores. Deepfake has been extensively trained on datasets such as Deeperforensics, DFDC, VoxCeleb, and deepfake videos created using locally captured (for video conferencing scenarios) images. Deepfake a form of AI which seamlessly stitches anyone in the world into a video or photo they never actually participated in. Sophisticated AI techniques have spurred a dramatic increase in the manipulation of media contents. Such techniques keep evolving and become more realistic. That makes detection difficult. The tool was presented at the 26th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, in the USA. The unique detector can also detect deepfakes on social media. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 93ISI KOLKATA : DEEP LEARNING FOR SCREENING COVID-19 USING CHEST X-RAY IMAGES Problem Solution Impact During the process, they could understand that pneumonia and COVID-19 had similar representation, which could further be made clear in a CT scan. There were two datasets used, one was from NIH Chest X-ray, and the other was acquired from four open-source databases- Italian Society of Medical Radiology and Intervention (25 cases), radiopaedia.org (20 Cases), J. Paul Cohen et al. COVID-19 image data collection (180 Cases), a hospital in Spain (80 Cases). The data was segregated into data set A-training and validation data with the numbers of normal and diseased cases. The data set B contained the number of normal cases, pneumonia, other diseases, and COVID-19. The DETL (Domain Extension Transfer Learning) algorithm was used in the study. The involved CNN models were trained from scratch on data set A to learn to classify between diseased and normal X-ray images. The next phase was to replace the last fully-connected layer of the pre-trained CNN with a new fully-connected layer, having as many neutrons as the number of classes, which in this case was 4, i.e., normal, other diseases, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The rest of the weights in the remaining layers of the pre-trained network are to be retained. Then the last convolution block and the fully connected layers are retrained using SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent).The ongoing pandemic has made inroads into the country and is now spiralling out of control. The first step to providing appropriate treatment is to detect the infection. But the CT scans which are typically used for COVID-19 patients are an expensive treatment. Therefore, the cost associated with the CT scans and their availability in rural areas is a constraint for a country as populous as India. The idea of using X-rays for screening is based on making the screening more affordable instead of CT scans that are expensive. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 94 ENTERPRISES 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 95 IBM: AI-BASED FARMER ADVISORY SERVICES TO IMPROVE FARM YIELD AND INCOME Problem Soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil health are a few of the critical inputs required for precision agricultural applications - these applications include irrigation scheduling, crop health management, pests and diseases prediction, and estimation of yield and acreage. As India is not a water-rich country, farmers need to have an accurate understanding of spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture and temperature to achieve optimum water utilization in all agriculture applications. The soil moisture and temperature can be measured by using instruments in the field, including remote sensing techniques or a physics-based Land Surface Model (LSM). However, these methods are not always reliable and accurate because of noisy high-resolution data and dependencies on data quality. This creates several large discrepancies across the models. Furthermore, for Indian farms, the data from the past - including soil moisture, LSM data, and remotely sensed data needs to be regularly cross-validated to ensure consistency and quantifying uncertainties. This is because India is categorized by different climate zones. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 96Solution Keeping this in mind, IBM developed a robust technology platform to address some of the fundamental challenges in improving farm yield and farming income in India. The technology is based on the data fusion approach. Data from The Weather Company, satellites, and the IoT-based field data were combined using AI technology to provide timely, localized and actionable agriculture advisory to farmers. The AI system combined the weather data and the analytics on a field-by-field basis - this enabled the Indian farmers to make informed decisions, leading to better crop output throughout the year. The aim of developing the AI system was to provide highly affordable and scalable Farmer Advisory Services by combining Remote sensing, Weather data, and Local sensing via IoT. The farmer advisory services include: Impact The AI model improved the quality of work of the farmers. The farmers were able to get the required information via a smartphone, saving time travelling to Agri Labs in search of solutions. The high-resolution soil moisture and soil temperature service were used as a real-time decision support system for precision agriculture in India.Pest/Disease Advisory: The AI system integrated weather forecast models and crop health data - this provided the farmers with crop-specific pest and disease risk prediction. For example, the farmers were aware of when and how much pesticide/ insecticide had to be applied.Irrigation Advisory: The AI system leveraged real-time weather data from weather sensors. This data provided suggestions on irrigation management by estimating the soil moisture levels - this ensured that the crops received the right mix of sun and water.Nutrient Advisory: The AI system provided farmers with inputs on fertilizer usage - thus maximizing output. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 97INTEL  SANKARA EYE FOUNDATION: HARNESSING AI TO TRANSFORM DIABETIC RETINOPATHY DIAGNOSIS  TREATMENT Problem Solution Impact To address this challenge, Sankara Eye Foundation collaborated with Leben Care to implement a cloud-based AI solution based on the Intel Xeon Scalable processor platform, powered by Intel Deep Learning Boost (Intel DL Boost). Netra.AI, a comprehensive retina risk assessment software-as-a-service platform available on cloud, has been trained to be device-agnostic to specialized low-powered microscopes with attached cameras. It provides the option to be used as both online and offline modules, such as a standalone box. The solution uses cutting- edge algorithms, developed in collaboration with leading retina experts, with a four-step Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). This neural network helps in detecting retinal photographs from non-retinal images, sensing generic quality distortion for automated image quality assessment, detecting the DR stage. It also helps in annotating the lesions based upon pixel density in the fundus images. India has one of the largest diabetic populations of any country in the world, approaching the alarming mark of 98 million cases by 2030. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the major cause for blindness and vision loss in persons of working age. Hence, early detection and treatment are critical to stopping the damage. However, with majority of the population based in rural India, the lack of well-trained ophthalmologists to identify DR  especially in remote rural regions  is a major concern. Also, there remains a huge gap in the number of patients and the needed medical care and infrastructure available in the country. Netra.AI has the ability to identify healthy retina from an unhealthy one, which makes it a great tool to screen retinal disorders in a large population with limited infrastructure and resources for tertiary healthcare. The model is trained to identify different stages of diabetic retinopathy, and suggest whether the patient may need an early referral or regular monitoring. Furthermore, it can identify glaucoma, which can be a great tool for early screening of this progressive disorder that leads to blindness, and thus help in early treatment and control. The comprehensive report generated by Netra.AI within 2 minutes of uploading the images enables optometrists or imaging technicians to provide instant counsel for patients needing a referral to the hospital. The solution also delivers excellent sensitivity and accuracy while detecting any DR, i.e., 99.7 percent and 98.5 percent respectively. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 98GOOGLE  CENTRAL W ATER COMMISSION: USING AI TO PREDICT FLOODS AND SAVE LIVES Problem Solution To simulate the water behaviour across a floodplain, inundation modelling uses as inputs measurement or forecast of river water levels and high resolution elevation maps. Real-time river measurements and forecasts are obtained for this initiative through Googles collaboration with the Central Water Commission (CWC), the technical organization of India in the field of water resources. Google has devised a new approach for inundation modelling, called a morphological inundation model, which combines physics-based modelling with ML to create more accurate and scalable inundation models in real- world settings. In comparison to classical physics-based models, this morphological model improves accuracy by 3 percent, which can significantly improve forecasts for large areas, while also allowing for much more rapid model development by reducing the need for manual modeling and correction. Additionally, their alert-targeting model allows identifying areas at risk of flooding at unprecedented scale using end-to-end machine learning models and data that is publicly available globally. They have also developed HydroNets  a specialised deep neural network architecture built specifically for water levels forecasting  which allows the utilization of some exciting recent advances in ML-based hydrology in a real- world operational setting.Flooding is the most common natural disaster on the planet, affecting hundreds of millions of people and causing between 6,000 and 18,000 fatalities every year  of which 20 percent are in India. Reliable early warning systems have been shown to prevent a significant fraction of fatalities and economic damage, but many people dont have access to those types of warning systems. The Google Flood Forecasting Initiative aims to use Googles infrastructure and machine learning expertise for providing accurate real-time flood forecasting information and alerts to those in affected regions. This is made possible through AI and physics-based modelling which create accurate and scalable inundation models in real-world settings. With reliable on-ground data obtained from governmental agencies, Googles river flood forecasting models can more accurately predict not only when and where a flood might occur, but the severity of the event as well. Through an innovative approach for inundation modelling, the initiative aims to provides unprecedented lead time, accuracy and clarity in flood forecasting. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 99Impact First piloted in the Patna region of Bihar in 2018, Googles flood forecasting initiative has been extended to the whole of India by 2020, covering 200 million people across more than 250,000 sq km. Google technology is being used to improve the targeting of every alert the government sends; around 30 million notifications have been sent to people in flood affected areas, to date. The alerts sent out include three tiers of risk: some flood risk, greater flood risk, and greatest flood risk. For better accessibility, the information is provided in different formats so that people can both read their alerts and see them presented visually; they have added support for Hindi, Bengali and seven other local languages, too. Google.org has started a collaboration with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to build local networks that can get disaster alert information to people who wouldnt otherwise receive smartphone alerts directly. A partner notification infrastructure has been established to provide these forecasts for the CWC and other organisational partners that can use it to prepare for disaster management and relief efforts. Googles initiative is providing people with information about flood depth: when and how much flood waters are likely to rise. And in areas where it is possible to produce depth maps throughout the floodplain, they are sharing information about depth in the users village or area. The recent improvement to the forecasting model has allowed them to double the lead time of many of their alerts  providing more notice to governments and giving tens of millions of people an extra day or so to prepare. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 100BKC WEATHERSYSTEMS: AI FOR WEATHER ADVISORY IN ADV ANCE FOR CROPS Problem Solution Impact BKC WeatherSys Pvt. Ltd. (formerly known as BK Consimpex Pvt. Ltd.) is one of Indias first few private sector meteorology and environmental technology companies. Founded in 1989, BKC WeatherSys provides turn-key technology and service solutions for weather, power, aviation, agriculture and solar energy industries. Through the Fasal Salah app, farmers can get weather advisory in advance, which is related to the crops that they grow. This app can also act as a tool for crop insurance system, which is currently faced with challenges like delayed submission of yield data to assess damages as the system relies on thousands of crop-cutting experiments, lack of trust in the quality of such data, and delay in the payment of premium subsidy by the state governments to the insurance companies. There is a need for authentic information on the status of crop production before they mature in order to plan for imports, exports, or buffer well ahead of shortages or surpluses. The solution has resonated well with over 1 lakh farmers who are using the app to estimate yield, get information about traders, input providers, mandi prices, and receive highly personalized and hyper local weather forecasting. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 101IBM: AI-BASED CHATBOT TO HELP STUDENTS IN RURAL BENGAL LEARN ENGLISH Problem Solution Impact Professor Idiom is an AI-powered chatbot developed for Abheda Foundation, an NGO based in Kolkata. Professor Idiom is a persona, a witty professor who likes to joke and tells a good story. Developing a conversational AI- powered chatbot is a logical language-learning solution as it provides the liberty to express ones feelings which are missing when learning from English teaching apps or tutorial videos. Idioms have been fixed as a specific topic because an open-ended chatbot could be very difficult to build. With Professor Idiom, a student can send a chat asking for the meaning of an idiom in their local language and the bot will reply with the answer in English. A conversation can be continued for 10-15 minutes to find out how well a student can converse in English. For the team of developers at IBM, it took five weeks to have the first draft ready, and between three to four months to develop the content which was the more difficult part.When a group of IBM India employees, including data scientists and communication experts, volunteered to work on a tech solution that could help students learn the English language, the challenge was to figure out what that solution would be. The team had thought about multiple ways to design a solution that teaches students the English language, especially those from semi-urban and rural areas. During the early phase of the project, there had been discussions on creating videos to be distributed through WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, considering the reach of both platforms in India. The team also thought about developing an app, but decided against it as the common consensus was that the app would divert attention and focus instead of engaging students within the age group of 10 to 16. Discussions to develop an AI-based chatbot started in 2019, when the Abheda Foundation, an NGO run by a group of retired IT professionals providing digital education to students from rural parts of Bengal, approached IBM to incorporate AI and ML capabilities in their learning solutions. About 90 percent of Abheda Foundations 200 students are using Professor Idiom and this small number makes it easier to analyse the data and keep improving the AI-powered chatbot. The team is in the process of collecting data and this will help not only monitor the students progress but also improve the chatbot. Although a beta release, for now, students can access Professor Idiom by activating Google Assistant on their Android devices. There are further plans to make the chatbot available to larger users after the production release. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 102MICROSOFT: AI-BASED SOWING APP BY MICROSOFT FOR FARMING COMMUNITY IN ANDHRA PRADESH Problem ICRISAT realized the criticality to empower small-holder farmers in India to increase their income through higher crop yield and greater price control. Traditionally, Indian farmers from Andhra Pradesh sow seeds in the beginning of June every year. Changing climate patterns are varying the optimal conditions of sowing - making it difficult for farmers to predict the sowing date. Accuracy with the sowing date is critical for farmers to ensure harvesting of a good crop. Any failure in sowing can lead to a massive loss incurred through loss of seeds, fertilizer, and efforts by the farmers. To predict the sowing date, the standard process is to measure the Moisture Adequate Index (MAI) that assesses rainfall and soil moisture adequacy. MAI calculates the amount of water required for the crops and provides an optimal sowing period. The farmers needed a solution to assist in the accurate prediction of the sowing of seeds. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 103Solution Impact Microsoft partnered with the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) to develop an AI-powered sowing app for farmers to identify the optimal time for sowing the seeds. The application has been built on the Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite, which includes Machine Learning and Power BI - the platform systematically promotes digital farming practices in Andhra Pradesh. The sowing app was combined with the personalized village advisory dashboard for Andhra Pradesh. The village advisory dashboard was supported by a powerful business intelligence tool that was designed to provide cloud-based predictive analytics. The advanced analytics offered crucial information and insights for farmers to reduce crop failures and increase yield. The sowing app advised farmers on the best time to sow crops depending on weather conditions, soil, and other indicators. The advanced AI algorithms of the app were connected and interfaced with weather forecasting models - this included extensive data on rainfall from the last 45 years. The data included 10 of data on the groundnut sowing progress in the district. The massive data was then downscaled to build predictability - the resulting data assisted farmers with picking the ideal sowing week. To determine the optimal sowing period, the MAI was calculated for assessing the degree of adequacy of rainfall and soil moisture to understand the potential water requirement of crops. The MAI was calculated in real-time with the advanced AI algorithms. 10 sowing advisories were also initiated and disseminated until the harvesting was completed, including essential information covering optimal sowing date, soil test-based fertilizer application, farmyard manure application, seed treatment, and optimum sowing depth, among other parameters. The app utilized data collected manually from farms across 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh, the data was collected by ICRISAT field officers and uploaded to Azure Cloud. The intelligent BI tool provided essential insights around soil health, fertilizer recommendations, and can predict seven days weather forecast. In the pilot project, the information sent to farmers about the sowing date via SMS was sent in the Telugu language. The sowing app advised farmers about the optimal sowing period - this resulted in an increase of 10-30 percent yield per hectare. Overall, the solution reduced farming stress and generated better income. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 104YELLOW MESSENGER: AUTOMATED ONLINE RETAIL SOLUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PLATFORM Problem Solution Yellow Messenger deployed a channel-agnostic AI-powered interactive bot for Leo Coffee. Yellow Messenger also implemented Canary - its eCommerce solution for Leo Coffee. The bot solution included an AI-powered Virtual Assistant and NLP Engine support. Leo Coffees chatbot, named Leo, was deployed on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Business, and their web store Leo e-store. The intelligent virtual retail assistant enabled customers of Leo Coffee to browse in-store, place orders, track and confirm orders, and even place subscription orders while the customer was ordering another product. The virtual assistant provided exceptional customer engagement while responding to numerous queries from the customer. The bot was integrated with sentiment analysis to understand emojis and also reply with emojis. The other features that were provided cover: FAQs for faster query resolution, About Us section describing the history and details about Leo Coffee, nearby Store Locator to help customers find nearby stores, channel partner facilitation for business development related to store dealership, kiosk for supermarkets, packed coffee distribution, and vending machines installations. The Leo Store bot could be accessed from anywhere in India. The Bot child of Leo Bot was deployed across 4 regions to provide streamlined support, and deliver region-wise analytics. For the next phase, Yellow Messenger is integrating the platform with Shopifys API to enable abandoned cart notifications.Leo Coffee has 40 cafe outlets in South India and 300 distributors across India. It is a family-run coffee enterprise; the brand exports various coffee blends, vending machines, and coffee merchandise globally. Leo Coffee has an online presence, selling its products through online stores and also through its own Leo e-Store. With the onset of the pandemic, Leo Coffee shut down most of its services during the lockdown. Moreover, with social-distancing norms in place till the end of 2020, Leo Coffee experienced a sharp decline in its business across the cafe outlets and the sales of the packaged coffee through retail outlets. To circumvent this situation Leo Coffee aimed to expand its market to a younger crowd and continue serving packaged coffee - the organization planned to expand its sales via e-commerce channels. However, the business via these e-commerce channels was just over 1 percent prior to and during the initial period of the lockdown. To boost their online presence, the organization had to increase its customer support infrastructure to handle queries coming in from online customers and boost its online technology pack. With call-centers completely closed till June-July 2020, Leo Coffee required an automated customer service solution to resolve queries. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 105Impact Within a few days of deployment, the subscription order value provided by Leo Bot crossed Rs. 100,000 and the total order value crossed Rs. 150,000. Leo Coffee chatbot resolved customer queries with 100 percent accuracy 24/7/365. With region-wide analysis, the bot provided accurate data on coffee consumption across India and assisted Local Store managers in SKU management. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 106THRIDW ATCH (RAZORP AY): ECOMMERCE FRAUD DETECTION PLATFORM Problem RTO or Return-To-Origin is a situation wherein Online retail or E-commerce orders cannot be delivered and have to be shipped back to the warehouse/seller. The reasons for failure of delivery cover one or more of the following: incorrect or incomplete address provided by the, impulse purchases by the customer wherein he/she decides to cancel the order because of a delay in delivery or sourcing the same product for a better price from a different store/marketplace or fraudulent orders placed without any genuine intent. Another popular terminology for RTO orders is NDR which stands for Non-Delivery Report. RTO or NDR puts a significant cost burden on online sellers/ eMarketplaces as they lose a lot of money in shipping the order back and forth. Karatcart.com is an online jewelry store that offers one of the biggest curated collections of designer and handmade jewelry for women. RTO was at an all-time high for Karatcart and this began to affect its operational and marketing costs. For every return, a cost of Rs. 60 (0.80) approximately had to be incurred one way - or a total of Rs. 120 (1.60) when both forward and return logistics were included. RTOs caused huge overhead costs for KaratCart. The problem was broken down into 3 parts: KaratCarts customers typically came from Tier II and Tier III areas. One of the main issues that E-commerce companies face in such cities is the inconsistency in addresses. This directly impacts deliveries, leading to a higher percentage of returns. Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) is a popular payment option in India. Typically, higher RTO rates are observed when the mode of payment is CoD as the customer can cancel the order at any time. KaratCart, was an online store fairly new to the E-commerce trade - a significant proportion of customers (85-90 percent) were first-time shoppers. The RTO percentage of KaratCart was high as the online platform had no significant percentage of loyal or repeat customers. Hence, a comprehensive solution for KaratCarts business and scale was required. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 107Solution Impact KaratCarts digital payments were powered by one of Indias leading payment solutions enterprise - Razorpay. Razorpay implemented Thirdwatch, an e-commerce RTO and fraud detection and prevention platform, built specifically for the Indian E-commerce landscape. Powered by an Artificial Intelligence engine, Thirdwatch processed every order placed in the online store and analyzed a combination of order parameters and behavioral patterns of customers/users. To solve the issue related to RTO, a mix of merchant-specific learnings injected into the AI-engine was identified as the best solution. For KaratCart, Thirdwatch analyzed 200 parameters in a matter of milliseconds. Thirdwatch tackled the complex problem of RTO by utilizing a carefully crafted combination of seller-specific and rule-based algorithms on top of Thirdwatchs machine learning algorithms. It handled all major cases of RTO such as delivery address issues, impulse purchases of users, and fraud orders placed by delinquent users - it took a holistic approach to tackling RTO. KaratCart initiated the fraud prevention process by installing the Thirdwatch App on the Shopify App Store. Once integrated, KaratCarts orders were captured on the Thirdwatch platform. Within minutes, the Thirdwatch engine started flagging Karatcarts orders. It also utilized the Thirdwatch dashboard for deeper insights and for a detailed view of fraud profiling of their orders. The implementation was designed for easy use - the easy integration with Shopify enabled the availability of the risk flags (provided by Thirdwatch) on the Shopify dashboard. The implementation enabled KaratCart to make significant savings on operational costs related to RTO orders. Moreover, the logistics and marketing teams could spend the time saved on identifying and flagging RTO orders on other high-impact areas. Thirdwatchs solution was implemented in November 2020. One month after implementation, RTO rates for KaratCart started to fall, while sales numbers increased at a 20 percent growth rate month-on-month. After three months, Thirdwatch helped KaratCart reduce RTO by 36 percent. With the implementation, KaratCart directly saved Rs. 35,000 (approximately) for every 1000 orders every month. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 108MICROSOFT: E-MARKETPLACE PLATFORM FOR FARMERS Problem Solution The process of estimation and guesswork has been replaced by a scientific trading platform that enables farmers to sell their produce at an optimum price - this eMarketplace platform has been implemented by Microsoft for CropData. On this platform, CropData connects farmers with bulk buyers, where the harvest is hedged early in the crop cycle - this process depends on the predicted quality and yield of the potential harvest. For this implementation, Microsoft developed numerous tools and technologies on the eMarketplace platform for farmers - these tools included Dr. Krishi and Agriota. Dr. Krishi, a workflow-based platform, performed essential diagnostics on the farm based on information and data - the data was constantly monitored and analyzed. The platform also served as the primary interface for customized advisory services. Agriota connected all the stakeholders in the agri value-chain through the use of blockchain. Microsoft incorporated the AI-related workflows in their existing cloud-based agri platform, FarmBeats, into the workflows of CropDatas farm diagnostics process. The team from Microsofts Farmbeats integrated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and weather data pipelines for cloud correction - this enabled better accuracy of the weather forecasts. Once the farmers were on-boarded to the platform and their data entered into the platform, CropData performed farm land diagnostics. This process included crop health assessment with weather correlations, aerial imagery, seed variety and quality evaluation, sowing techniques, and soil stress levels, among others. The entire process was carried out on the Dr. Krishi module. Once the on-ground diagnostics were completed, the machine learning algorithm evaluated the health of the farm and the expected yield and quality of the produce from the land. The algorithm integrated and clubbed together farms with similar characteristics and features (in terms of risks, produce, harvest quality, and other health parameters). The farms were integrated and clubbed together based on the similar qualities and parameters of the farms. By grouping smaller farmland with larger farmland, the smaller farmland owners were provided economies of scale and fair prices that the larger farmland owners would automatically receive in the market. This grouping also provided farmers with access to institutional lines of credit at favorable rates.To estimate the income from farm yield, farmers in India have had to wait till their crops were harvested and the yield measured - the income was then estimated from the harvested yield. Alternatively, farmers carried out advance trades on agri-futures platforms, a process that has relied on guesswork on the prices on the futures market. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 109Impact As of the end of the calendar year 2020, the CropData platform has a footprint in 30 districts across eight states. The program is in the phase of expansion despite the risks due to COVID-19. 50,000 farmers have been onboarded to the marketplace. The Agriota platform has been launched with 18 farm commodities/ produce, each having anywhere between five to ten varieties. The data platform, Geospatial Tile Management, consistently aggregates information to provide insights at granular levels. The program has a short-term yet ambitious goal of on-boarding 150,000 farmers to the marketplace in the first year of implementation. The medium-term goal is to on-board over five million farmers in five years. If these goals are met, the impact and benefit in terms of gross merchandise value (of transactions) is expected to be USD 250 million in the first year and USD 8.5 billion over five years. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 110TIGER ANALYTICS: PLATFORM TO MEASURE THE EFFICACY OF AGRI-INPUTS Problem The study was aimed to measure the efficacy of agri-inputs on corn plants by estimating the size of the leaves of the corn plant. Corn develops in a progressive manner. The area of the leaf of the plant is used to determine the health of the plant. Unhealthy plants appear to have narrow and twisted leaves compared to healthy plants. The underlying goal of the study was, therefore, to measure the leaf area of corn plants. The specific metric to be studied was the Leaf Area Index, wherein the area is normalized by analyzing the ground area the leaf would typically occupy. The farm was divided into regions across which the specific interventions of agri-inputs had to be carried out. Prior to the implementation of the platform, leaves from corn plants were examined manually to measure the health of the plant. An expert would untangle and straighten each leaf to measure the dimensions of the plants along its length. This measurement was used to calculate the leaf area and then converted to the leaf area index for the plant. The manual process was extremely time consuming and made the process of measuring leaves across large swathes of plants untenable. This led to measurements that were carried out sporadically in controlled settings on a smaller set of plants, thereby affecting the overall study of the health of the plants. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 111Solution Impact The agrochemical company was seeking a partner to understand the feasibility of the project within the achievable accuracy of measurements and goals of the projects. The agrochemical company collaborated with Tiger Analytics to utilize drone images of the farm with deep-learning based image processing techniques to estimate the leaf area index. Moreover, the goal of the project was to study different parameters of the produce/ harvested land over a period of time. The near-term goal was to utilize drone imagery of the farm and determine growth parameters of individual plants and compare the produce of the farm regions that had different levels of fertilizer utilization. Tiger Analytics drove the solution design and execution of the project:  The drones were equipped with ZENMUSE cameras to capture high-quality images of the farm.  Additionally, the solution provider added markers on the ground to identify crop sections pertaining to those rows of corn plants that had to be examined.  Ground-reality data had to be developed from sample data/area of the leaves as creating such data from the manual inspection of the leaves was proving to be time-consuming. The agrochemical company was able to test the efficacy of different products across a large sample on the farms. The farm was divided into regions with different treatments - the growth parameters were accurately measured across several weeks and were fed back to the product research and development teams for analysis. The solution was developed for corn plants. However, in the future, other crops would be added to the process. The solution consisted of a unique and detailed method to create synthetic images, a robust and generalizable deep learning inference, strategic image capture and scoring pipeline with a clear path to derive farming intelligence from sensors. Outcome in terms of mean absolute error in identifying the images of diseased or affected crops was drastically lower for synthetic test images. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 112COGNIZANT: AI PLATFORM FOR BIOMETRIC DATA PROTECTION Problem Solution Impact Aadhar Card is one of the documents accepted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)/Indian financial institutions for verifying Know Your Customer (KYC) details. Given the privacy and data implications related to Aadhar card details, Indian financial service providers now need to comply with the 2019 Aadhaar Act privacy amendment provisions, wherein Indian companies must mask the individuals Aadhaar number for security reasons. Based on this new mandate, one large Indian insurance company sought to conceal the biometric numbers of its customers using an AI-based automated process. Moreover, the law also prohibited intermediate storage of data - therefore, the company had to identify proper techniques masking the data without disrupting its existing processes. The automated system provided a fully compliant solution that was easily scalable. The solution operated much faster than the traditional image masking techniques that used human intervention - moreover, the solution was fully compliant with RBIs process requirements. The solutions API did not store images during processing; thus, there was no risk of data leakage. The system provided 99 percent reduction in operational costs over manual masking with 100 percent image masking accuracy.To facilitate this, Cognizant, an IT and ITES provider, created an AI-enabled solution that masked the Insurance providers historical heterogeneous data and enabled future real-time Aadhaar image processing. This automated system processed the input image (of the Aadhar card) and provided a masked image as the output. The platform operated on a cognitive service-based machine learning model - this model was deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform. Moreover, the model masked all the background images, enabling masking of the customers image on the Aadhar card. The solution facilitated the processing of both long and short-format Aadhaar cards and masked the bar codes, QR codes, and Aadhar numbers. To identify the Aadhaar numbers in the image, the automated system utilized MS Azures Computer Vision technology - this technology enabled the identification and extraction of the numbers by leveraging Text Extraction/Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. The AI model was trained by utilizing sample data from the insurance provider - this enabled the identification of QR codes and barcodes. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 113ERNST  YOUNG: AI-DRIVEN CYBERSECURITY SOLUTION INSURANCE PROVIDERS Problem Solution The insurance provider engaged EY to establish a Managed Security Service (MSS) model to provide round-the- clock security monitoring and incident reporting. EY implemented an AI/ML-based security incident and event management process - the system could proactively monitor threats and determine response plans for complex cybersecurity breaches. The solutions AI and ML capabilities provided a comprehensive threat response that managed several non-core security processes. The solution collected useful data from the network, endpoint, cloud, container, and virtualized attack vectors - these enabled analysts to examine the entire picture throughout the kill chain. The AI capabilities could dismiss false positives allowing analysts to focus on real threats. The platform leveraged machine learning technology to improve its detection and response capabilities over time. The MSS model enabled the insurance company to secure its devices and information, and continuously monitor security threats. The solution was designed on the principle that cybersecurity is a product of constant vigilance rather than sporadic responses to cyber-attack.Cybersecurity threats for insurance and other financial companies are a major cause of concern for the financial services industry. Apart from any financial loss, valuable personal data is at risk in the eventuality of a breach. Moreover, the companys reputation and brand are adversely affected. Considering the potential fallout, and given the increase in the number of cyber-crimes, an Indian insurance company was looking to strengthen the organizational cybersecurity to protect the data, systems and infrastructure from potential cyber threats. The company also sought to deploy a 24/7 security log monitoring system that could conduct analytics, threat profiling, correlation and alerting. The company knew that to build a reliable cybersecurity function, it had to implement an AI/ML-based managed detection and response system and a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) system. Thus, this required the insurance service provider to team up with a reliable partner to build an information security and data breach management framework. The partner/solution provider had to deploy and operate the necessary capabilities for AI and ML enablement. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 114Impact After the deployment of EYs AI-based solution, the insurance company pre-empted active threats and analyzed potential vulnerabilities. The implementation of the solution decreased the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) incidents related to perimeter traffic and antivirus by more than 70 percent. The implementation resulted in a 48 percent reduction in the number of anomalies and offences within 3 months. Finally, the implementation resulted in a 67 percent reduction in the number of phishing emails within 3 months. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 115MAHINDRA  MAHINDRA: KRISH-E NIDAAN - A CROP DISEASE AND PEST RECOGNITION SOLUTION Problem Solution Impact Mahindra  Mahindras Farm Equipment Sector (FES) developed Krish-e Nidaan, an advanced crop disease and pest recognition solution, to enable Indian farmers improve farm yields. Krish-e Nidaan enabled early-stage diagnosis and provided control measures for crop diseases and pests.Some sections of the Indian farming community still struggle to optimize farm yields affected by pests and crop disease. Although farmers receive information about managing and controlling pests and diseases from several sources, such information is not always accurate - this leads to crop damage and a reduction in overall farm output. Incidence of pests and crop diseases increase the expenses of farmers as regular spraying of farms are required to protect the crops. Since the launch of the platform in October 2020, the utilization and adoption of the Krish-e Nidaan solution has significantly enabled farmers to improve the accuracy of disease detection and decision-making with regards to application of pesticides and chemicals. This has increased yield and farm income per acre. The Krish-e-Nidaan solution has increased the yield of farmers by 15 percent and brought down the cost of farming by 8-12 percent. In those areas where Krish-e-Nidaan has been implemented, the solution has helped increase profits by Rs 6000 per acre. Till the last quarter of the 2020 calendar year, MMs FES team worked on close to 10,000 crop diagnosis reports. The solution has responded to thousands of diagnosis queries per second, with little or no expert intervention. This has helped farmers in early and mid-stage identification of crop diseases and expert advisory. The platform is expected to add 3-times more disease support functions by October 2021. The system is expected to achieve a performance score of more than 95 percent by the end of 2021. 75 @ 75: Indias AI Journey 116TCS: INTELLIGENT DAIRY FARM ASSISTANT Problem Solution Impact The Intelligent Dairy Farm Assistant is a combination of two advanced technologies  AI  motor sensors. The latter is tied to the cows neck to transmit data and the AI can decipher patterns after an adequate amount of data is collected. Accordingly, alerts can be sent to the farmer when theres a change in pattern that warrants human intervention. TCS uses AI systems to match existing cattle breed with suitable mates for cross-breading. When the calf is born, it is issued a digital certificate and marked as a probable high-yielding milk producer. TCS has leveraged its co-innovation network comprising tech startups and expert bodies such as BAIF  Indian Agriculture Research Institute. The average annual milk yield of Indian cattle is 1172 kg which is 50 percent of the global average. The obvious implication is that cattle need to be cared for in a much better manner, and human efforts need to be complemented through tech intervention. Its the very same idea that we see in the industry  technology augmenting productivity for the human in the loop. The quality of milk is dependent on breeding. Imperfections in this process can lead to poor/weak progeny. But it can be addressed scientifically and thats precisely what TCSs AI-enabled solutions offer under their mKrishi platform. Monitoring systems aided by IoT sensors, bots, and AI is at the heart of a smart cowhouse. Detailed observation by AI-powered image analysis can detect illnesses early, including injuries. It can be imagined on the lines of a system which monitors cows 24/7/365 to ensure they stay healthy to maximize their value. These vital signs play a critical role when artificial insemination is carried out leading to higher quality breeding. CONCLUSION When looking back at Indias growth story, the pivotal role played by technology, especially over the past two decades, cannot be overlooked. Of all of these technologies, that drive socio-economic impact, artificial intelligence is well on its way to becoming the strongest contender to drive future growth. While still in its nascent stage, AI is projected to add  500 billion to Indias GDP by 2025 and, as one would expect, this number is poised to grow exponentially in the coming decades. This booklet celebrates Indias thriving AI sector, as we celebrate Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, by showcasing some of the most impactful and creative uses of AI to solve important challenges in business and society today. The sheer volume and diversity of solutions accurately capture Indias versatility and prowess in the field of AI, and the immense scope for innovation that exists in the market. Armed with the right strategy and backed by suitable talent, India is unstoppable in its pursuit of an AI-driven future for its citizens and for the world. Editorial Team a.

DIGITAL BHARAT, SAKSHAM BHARAT A COMPENDIUM ON DIGITAL INDIA PREFACE Indias digital story is one of an ICT - led development by use of technology that is affordable, inclusive and transformative. The Digital India Programme aims to transform India into a knowledge-based economy and a digitally empowered society. Through Aadhaar, the Government has provided digital identity to 123 crore residents of the country with 99 % coverage of adult population. The combination of Jandhan bank Accounts, mobile phones and digital identity through Aadhaar i.e. JAM trinity is helping the poor in receiving the benefits directly into their bank account. A total of Rs. 6.21 lakh crore have been disbursed through Aadhaar based DBT to beneficiaries of 438 Government schemes which, have led to saving of over Rs. 1.1 lakh crore in the last 4 years by removing fictitious claimants. Increased use of Digital Payments in the country has brought about transparency and accountability. Over the past four years, digital payment transactions have grown multifold. BHIM/UPI has grown multi-fold in the span of two years. UPI consumers made over 67 crore transactions with a value of over Rs. 1 lakh crore in the month of January, 2019 alone. Currently, there are 134 banks offering UPI services to their customers. Digital Delivery of Services has simplified the way citizens interact with the Government to avail various services and has enhanced the ease of living of the citizens. National Scholarship Portal has 1.4 crore students registered and scholarships worth Rs 5,295 crore disbursed in the last three years. Jeevan Pramaan has improved the ease of verification of pensioners using Aadhaar. 2.48 Crore Digital Life Certificates have been submitted since 2014. DigiLocker provides access to over 349 crore certificates in digital format on a single platform. To make governance easily accessible to people, UMANG (Unified Mobile Application For New Age Governance) is the platform created by the Government that enables access of 339 Government services to the citizens through their mobile phones, thus expanding the digital outreach of the citizens. There has been a stupendous growth in Electronic Transactions (e-Transactions) in various e-Governance services. Over 8,919 crore e-Transactions have been recorded since its inception, till December, 2018. Common Services Centres (CSCs) are bringing e-Services to the doorsteps of people in the rural areas in an affordable manner. There are around 3.12 lakh CSCs across the country providing over 350 services ranges across sectors like education, health, agriculture etc. and have generated employment to 12 lakh persons including 55,000 women. CSCs have become centres of digital empowerment being actively involved in providing digital literacy. Under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), the Government is implementing the worlds largest digital literacy programme under which 1.96 crore people in rural backward areas have already been imparted training to become digitally literate and a total of 6 crore will be trained, thus, bridging the digital divide and helping people access benefits of the digital world. The BPO movement for smaller towns aims to create employment opportunities and secure a balanced regional growth by promoting local entrepreneurs, employment to women and differently-abled persons. It has the potential to generate around 1.5 lakh employment opportunities. 53,300 seats are allocated to 184 companies, resulting in setting up of 268 units distributed across 110 locations of 26 States  2 UTs. BPOs have started operation at several locations, including, Bhaderwah, Budgam, Jammu, Sopore and Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, Guwahati, Kohima, Imphal in North-Eastern region, Baddi and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, Patna and Muzzaffarpur in Bihar, Jaleshwar in Odisha.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 12 MINISTRY OF ELECTRONICS  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 1 In his speech on the occasion of Independence Day in 2014, Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, said I dream of Digital India to connect each and every citizen of the country and provide easy, effective and economic governance (i,e. Good Governance) in the country. To realize the vision, Digital India programme was envisioned as an ambitious umbrella programme to prepare India for a knowledge based transformation. Launched in July 2015, Digital India programme was conceived as a game changer from the perspective of Good Governance with a synchronised and coordinated engagement of the entire Government. This transformational programme has been designed to build holistic capabilities across infrastructure, manufacturing, skills and delivery platforms which, in turn, will lead to the creation of a self-reliant knowledge economy. The focus of Digital India programme is on being transformative  to realise IT (India Today)  IT (Information Technology)  IT (India Tomorrow) and to make technology at the center to enable change. Digital India programme identifies three vision areas - Digital Infrastructure as a Utility to Every Citizen, Governance and Services on Demand and Digital Empowerment of Citizens. Digital Infrastructure as a Utility to Every Citizen , includes, availability of high-speed internet for delivery of services to citizens; digital identity for every citizen; mobile phone and bank account enabling citizens participation in digital and financial space; shareable private space on a public cloud; and safe and secure cyberspace. Governance and Services on Demand , includes, seamlessly integrated services across departments or jurisdictions; services availability in real time from online and mobile platforms; digitally transformed services for improving ease of doing business; leveraging GIS for decision support systems and development.Digital Empowerment of Citizens , includes, universal digital literacy; accessible digital resources universally; all documents/certificates to be available on cloud; ensuring citizen engagement through myGov; availability of digital resources/ services in Indian languages; and portability of all entitlements through cloud. The programme is aimed at providing the required thrust to the nine pillars of growth: Broadband Highways; Universal Access to Mobile Connectivity; Public Internet Access Programme; e-Governance: Reforming Government through Technology; eKranti-Electronic Delivery of Services; Information for All; Electronics Manufacturing: Target Net Zero Imports; IT for Jobs and Early Harvest Programmes. Digital India programme has been coordinated by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology with Ministries and Departments in the Central and the State Governments, partnering it in their respective domain areas. India is in a sharply accelerating lift-off phase of its digital journey. Having built a strong foundation of digital infrastructure and expanded digital access, India is now poised for the next phase of growth  the creation of tremendous economic value and empowerment of millions of Indians as new digital applications permeate sector after sector. Indias story of digital transformation is one of digital empowerment and digital inclusion, for digital transformation based on technology that is affordable, inclusive and developmental. All this ensures that with an aim of Minimum Government, Maximum Governance, ease of living of the citizens is at the core of Digital India. Digital India programme has transformed the lives of 1.3 billion citizens of India with a robust foundation of Digital Infrastructure, Digital Identity, Digital Delivery of Services, Digital Literacy, Digital Skilling, Digital Payments to ensure Digital Access to All and Digital Empowerment through inclusion.DIGITAL INDIA: A BACKGROUND MINISTRY OF ELECTRONICS  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 1 MINISTRY OF ELECTRONICS  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 2 MINISTRY OF ELECTRONICS  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3The core of Digital India programme is to create internet access for every citizen to improve accessibility even in the remotest part of the country. Digital India push is meant to serve the poor and protect their interests. Digital economy push by the Government has seen an allround increase and disbursal of benefits to the poor through digital means to their bank accounts by removing fictitious beneficiaries and middlemen. As envisioned by Honble Prime Minister, New India can be realised only if the fruits of development reach all. Digital India has facilitated access of the digital world to the citizens and has provided power to the masses. 1.1 Digital Infrastructure Under Digital India programme, a key vision area is to provide a digital infrastructure as a utility to every citizen, starting from delivering digital identity to 1.3 billion citizens, linking about 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats by an optical fibre network and improving access in the rural areas. 1.1.1 Digital Identity Overview Aadhaar is the worlds largest digital identity programme that provides biometric and demographic based unique digital identity; which can be authenticated anytime, from anywhere and also eliminates duplicate and fake identities. It provides an identity infrastructure for the delivery of various social welfare programmes. The potential of Aadhaar can be realised, through its use of the infrastructure as a digital identifier and as a unique parameter by various Central Ministries, State Departments, PSUs and private sector entities to provide service delivery to residents in an integrated fashion. A total of 123.3 crore Aadhaar have been generated.Transformative Impact Aadhaar is not just a proof or identification of citizenship, but also an important digital identity used by citizens for various purposes, such as, availing benefits of Government services or schemes (such as LPG subsidy); access to Government based apps for Indian citizens (such as BHIM); proof for getting other important Government documents (such as a passport); and for other important aspects, such as, school scholarships, Digilocker for archiving documents, bank accounts under Prandhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana ( PMJDY ), provident funds account, pensions, driving license, insurance policies and loan waivers amongst other services.1.
