Since the inception of the Information Technology Act in 2000, this division has been at the forefront, fostering electronic transactions, providing legal validation for e-commerce, facilitating e-governance, preventing computer-based crimes, and implementing robust security measures.\nA notable recent addition to the division’s initiatives is the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023, a landmark legislation that adeptly balances individual privacy rights with the imperative to process digital personal data for lawful purposes. The IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules of 2021 further showcase the division’s commitment to regulating social media intermediaries, online gaming, and safeguarding digital citizens. The establishment of a Grievance Appellate Committee reflects the division’s dedication to resolving social media grievances where grievance officers couldn’t provide relief to the social media users in India.\nMoreover, the division actively pioneers frameworks for data governance and protection, crucial for establishing an open, safe, trusted, accountable, and adaptable cyberspace. Acknowledging data protection as a fundamental right for Indian citizens, the division formulates policies to safeguard these rights. Furthermore, the division delves into the legal implications of cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence, while also addressing aspects of Competition Law, Company Law, Copyright Act, and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection within the domain of information technology. In essence, the division operates as a guardian of digital rights, ensuring a secure cyberspace that is indispensable for the nation’s digital economy growth.”\n",

Towards this end, it has identified several Mission\nMode Projects (MMP s) both at the Central and State levels, aimed at readying various central and\nstate government departments and organizations for electronic delivery of services including\nseveral other e -Governance initiatives also being undertaken by the State governments and the\nCentral Ministr ies.\nNEGP recognizes that creation of independent infrastruc ture required to ensure service delivery\nby each department is neither cost -effective for government nor convenient for the citizen .\nConsidering the need for creating reliable access network throughout the country, State Wide\nArea Network (SWAN) has been i dentified as one of the MMPs under the NEGP. Department of\nInformation Technology (DIT), Government of India is the nodal department for SWAN MMP and\nCabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the SWAN Scheme for\nimplementation in 29 States and 6 Union Territories. The SWAN Scheme proposes to establish a\nminimum 2 Mbps connectivity up to the block level through extension and /orcreation of NICNET/\nState Wide Area Networks (SWANs) across the country.\nThe SWAN Policy Guidelines formulated by D IT provide sStates with two options for implementing\nSWAN and these options are detailed below.\nOption I: State to identify a suitable PPP model (BOO, BOOT etc.), select an appropriate agency\nthrough a suitable competitive process for outsourcing establish ment, operation and maintenance\nof the SWAN . The State will need to designate an appropriate nodal agency to take overall\nresponsibility for receipt of funding support, implementation and rendering accounts/ Utilization\nCertificates. The entire process of outsourcing, including advising on the most appropriate PPP\nmodel, could be managed by an appropriate consultancy organization to be engaged by the\ndesignated agency through a transparent process under the direction of an implementation\ncommittee to be est ablished by the State.\nOption II : Designate NIC as the prime implementation agency for establishment and maintenance\nof the SWAN , with an appropriate end -to-end Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this alternative,\nfunds would be released to NICSI by Departm ent of IT and execution would be carried out by NIC.\nGiven the importance and the intricacies involved in implementing SWAN (especially through\nOption I), many States have voiced the need for technical assistance through appointment of\nConsulting Agency fo r supporting them in this initiative . Considering the implementation\nrequirements of SWAN, the technical assistance which may be provided by the consultants can be\nsegregated into three distinct areas relating to:\nProject Conceptualization; Preparation of Detailed Project Report, Request for Proposal (RFP)\nfor selection of the SWAN Operator andthe related Service Level Agreements (SLAs) .\n\nTechnical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI\n-3-Implementation assistance including support in bid process management, selection of Network\nOperator and Project Monitor ing during Implementation\nNetwork Monitoring for ensuring SWAN performance in compliance withSLAs\nThesebroad Guidelines have been prepared in order to:\nassist State Governments in defining the role and responsibilities of the Project Consultants in\nvarious phases of SWAN project ;\ndocument the various options available to the State Governments for engaging the services of\nthe Consulting Agency for various elements of work as outlined above and\ndocument the p ossible Payment Terms for such consulting assign ments\n2.Role of the Project Consultants under SWAN\nConsidering the size and complexity of the SWAN implementation exercise, the role of Project\nConsultants can be segregated into three phases. The choice of whether a single Agency is to be\nhired upfront to u ndertake all the three phases or whether separate project consultant for each\nphase could be hired , isleft to the discretion of the State Governments. It may be mentioned\nthough that since hiring of project consultants is often a time consuming activity ,it may be\nappropriate for the State Governments to hire services of a reputed agency for all the three\nphases subject to suitable Terms and Conditions for each phase. This would help State\nGovernments to get the most competitive offers and advantage of tim e.\nThe detailed Scope of Work to be performed by the selected consultants in each phase is\ndescribed below. Depending on its readiness and requirement , the State may customise the\nScope of Work suitably.\n2.1Phase I –Project Conceptualization; Preparat ion of Detailed Project Report, and Service\nLevel Agreements\nSuggested Time Period –6-8 weeks\nTo make a preliminary assessment of the existing network Infrastructure of the State at\nall the levels including State head quarters, Districts, Taluks /Blocks.

Itis felt that\nassignments un der SWAN implementation are of technical nature and the other techno -\nadministrative issues are critical to State and thus there may be a need to balance between the\ncost and quality. Keeping the same in view, QCBS and Least Cost Selection are the most\nappropriate methods. However, It is left to the discretion of the State Governments to choose one\nof the models suggested below for appointment of the Consulting Agency taking into account their\nown procedures and process.\n3.1. Quality and Cost Based Selection (Q CBS)\nQCBS uses a competitive process among “short -listed” agencies that takes into account the\nquality of the proposal and the cost of the services in the selection of the successful firm. Cost as\n\nTechnical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI\n-9-a factor of selection shall be used judiciously. The relati ve weight age to be given to the quality\nand cost shall be determined for each case depending on the nature of the assignment. Typically\nthe ratio between quality and cost is 70:30. The evaluation of the proposals under this system\nshall be carried out in two stages: first the quality, and then the cost. Evaluators of technical\nproposals shall not have access to the financial proposals until the technical evaluation. Financial\nproposals shall be opened only thereafter. The quality evaluation shall be carrie d out in full\nconformity with the provisions of the RFP which would clearly state the process and weight age.\nState Governments can evaluate each technical proposal (using an Evaluation Committee of three\nor more specialists in the sector), taking into acc ount several criteria: (a) the Consultant's\nrelevant experience for the assignment, (b) the quality of the methodology proposed, (c) the\nqualifications of the key staff proposed, (d) transfer of knowledge , and (e) the extent of\nparticipation among key staf f in the performance of the assignment.\n3.1.1 At the end of the quality evaluation process, State Governments shall prepare an\nEvaluation Report onthe \"quality\" of the proposals. The report shall substantiate the results of\nthe evaluation and describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposals. All records\nrelating to the evaluation, such as individual mark sheets, shall be retained until completion of\nthe project and its audit. After the evaluation of quality is completed, the State Governmen t\nshall notify those consultants whose proposals did not meet the minimum qualifying mark or were\nconsidered non responsive to the RFP and Scope of Work, indicating that their financial proposals\nwill be returned unopened after completing the selection pro cess. State Governments shall\nsimultaneously notify the consultants that have secured the minimum qualifying mark, and\nindicate the date and time set for opening the financial proposals. The financial proposals shall be\nopened publicly in the presence of r epresentatives of the consultants who choose to attend. The\nname of the consultant, the quality scores, and the proposed prices shall be recorded when the\nfinancial proposals are opened. The total score shall be obtained by weighting the quality and\ncost s cores and adding them. The weight for the \"cost\" shall be pre -defined taking into account\nthe complexity of the assignment and the relative importance of quality.\n3.2. Quality -Based Selection (QBS)\nQBS is appropriate for the following types of assignments:\ncomp lex or highly specialized assignments for which it is difficult to define precise TOR and\nthe required input from the consultants\nassignments that have a high downstream impact and in which the objective is to have the\nbest experts; and\nassignments that ca n be carried out in substantially different ways, such that p roposals will\nnot be comparable\n3.2.1 In QBS, the RFP may request submission of a technical proposal only (without the financial\nproposal), or request submission of both technical and financial p roposals at the same time, but in\n\nTechnical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI\n-10-separate envelopes (two -envelope system). The RFP shall not provide the estimated budget, but it\nmay provide the estimated number of key staff time, specifying that this information is given as\nan indication only, and that consultants shall be free to propose their own estimates. If technical\nproposals alone were invited, after evaluating the technical proposals using the same\nmethodology as in QCBS, the State Government shall ask the Consultant with the highest ranked\ntechnical proposal to submit a detailed financial proposal. The State Government and the\nConsultant shall then negotiate the financial proposal and the contract. All other aspects of the\nselection process shall be identical to those of QCBS. If, however, cons ultants were requested to\nprovide financial proposals initially together with the technical proposals, safeguards shall be\nbuilt to ensure that the price envelope of only the selected proposal is opened and the rest\nreturned unopened, after the negotiation s are successfully concluded. It may be noted that the\nabove process requires significant expertise on behalf of the Government to undertake a proper\ntechnical evaluation so that subjectivity does not creep. This process also does not provide for\ncost comp etitiveness.\n3.3. Selection under a Fixed Budget\nThis method is appropriate only when the assignment is simple and can be precisely defined and\nalso when the budget for consultancy is fixed. The RFP shall indicate the available budget and\nrequest the consultant s to provide their best technical and financial proposals in separate\nenvelopes, within the budget. TOR should be particularly well prepared to make sure that the\nbudget is sufficient for the consultants to perform the expected tasks. Evaluation of all tec hnical\nproposals shall be carried out first as in the QCBS method. Then the price envelopes shall be\nopened in public. Proposals that exceed the indicated budget shall be rejected. The Consultant\nwho has submitted the highest ranked technical proposal amon g the rest shall be selected and\ninvited to negotiate a contract.\n3.4. Least -Cost Selection\nThis method is more appropriate to selection of consultants for assignments of a standard or\nroutine nature where well-established practices and standards exist, and in which the contract\namount is small. Under this method, a \"minimum\" qualifying mark for the \"quality\" is established.\nProposals to be submitted in two envelopes are invited from a short list. Technical envelopes are\nopened first and evaluated. Those securin g less than the minimum are rejected and the financial\nenvelopes of the rest are opened in public. The firm with the lowest price shall then be selected.\nUnder this method, the qualifying minimum mark shall be established, keeping in view that all\nproposal s above the minimum qualifying mark compete only on \"cost.\" The minimum mark shall be\nstated in the RFP.\n3.5. Single -Source Selection\nSingle -source selection of consultants does not provide the benefits of competition in regard to\nquality and cost. It lacks tr ansparency in selection, and could encourage unacceptable practices.\nTherefore, single -source selection shall be used only in exceptional cases. The justification for\n\nTechnical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI\n-11-single -source selection shall be examined in the context of the overall interests of the State\nGovernment and the project\n4.Suggested Payment Terms\nAll the activities, being multifarious and involving numerous agencies, necessitate involvement of\na competent, unbiased and professional consultant agency and a competent project manager to\nassist t he State Government. The responsibility lies with the State Government to select such a\nprofessional agency that can help them to achieve their objective of setting up the\ncommunication backbone network for e -governance applications. While t he State may co nsider\nadopting any of the models mentioned below for finalizing the payment terms (contract) to the\nproject consulting agency based on its requirements & procedures, Firm Fixed Price Contract &\nFirm Fixed Price Contract/Time Based Contract are the most ap propriate ones for Phase I & II and\nPhase III respectively.\n4.1. Lump Sum (Firm Fixed Price) Contract\nLump sum contracts can be used in which the content and the duration of the services and the\nrequired output of the consultants are clearly defined (Phase I i n 7.1 & Phase II in Section 7.1).\nThey are widely used for simple planning and feasibility studies, environmental studies, detailed\ndesign of standard or common structures, preparation of data processing systems, and so forth.\nPayments are linked to output s (deliverables), such as DPR, SLA, bills of quantities, bidding\ndocuments, etc. Lump sum contracts are easy to administer because payments are due on clearly\nspecified outputs.\n4.2. Time -Based Contract\nThis type of contract is appropriate when it is difficul t to define the Scope and the length of\nservices, either because the services are related to external activities by others for which the\ncompletion period may vary, or because the input of the consultants required to attain the\nobjectives of the assignment is difficult to assess. This type of contract is widely used for complex\nstudies, supervision of implementation (Phase II in 7.2 & Phase III inf Section 7.3 ), advisory\nservices, and most training assignments. Payments are based on agreed hourly, daily, weekly, or\nmonthly rates for staff (who are normally named in the contract) and on reimbursable items using\nactual expenses and/or agreed unit prices. The rates for staff include salary, social costs,\noverhead, fee (or profit), and, where appropriate, spec ial allowances. This type of contract shall\ninclude a maximum amount of total payments to be made to the consultants. This ceiling amount\nshould include a contingency allowance for unforeseen work and duration, and provision for price\nadjustments, where ap propriate. Time -based contracts need to be closely monitored and\nadministered by the client to ensure that the assignment is progressing satisfactorily, and\npayments claimed by the consultants are appropriate.\n\nTechnical Assistance for Implementation of S WAN DIT, GoI\n-12-4.3. Retainer and/or Contingency (Success) Fee Co ntract\nThe remuneration of the Consultant includes a retainer and a success fee, the latter being\nnormally expressed as a percentage of a price. In the instant case, it could be applicable for\nPhase II & III, and it could be a percentage of the contract va lue.\n4.4. Percentage Contract\nThese contracts are commonly used only for architectural and construction services. They may be\nalso used for procurement and project monitoring (Phase III). Percentage contracts directly relate\nthe fees paid to the Consultant to the estimated or actual project construction cost, or the cost\nof the goods procured or inspected. The contracts are negotiated on the basis of market norms for\nthe services and/or estimated staff -month costs for the services, or competitively bid.\n4.5. Indef inite Delivery Contract (Price Agreement)\nThese contracts are used to have \"on call\" specialized services to provide advice on a particular\nactivity, the extent and timing of which cannot be defined in advance. These are commonly used\nto retain \"advisers\" normally for a period of a year or more. The State Government and the agency\nhave to agree on the unit rates to be paid for the experts, and payments are made on the basis of\nthe time actually used.",

PREAMBLE \n1.1. Electronics industry is the world’s largest and fas test growing industry and is increasingly finding \napplications in all sectors of the economy. The Gov ernment attaches high priority to electronics \nhardware manufacturing and it is one of the importa nt pillars of both “Make in India” and “Digital \nIndia” programmes of Government of India. Besides t he economic imperative, focus on electronics \nhardware manufacturing up to the integrated circuit or chip level is required due to the growing \nsecurity concerns. The ESDM industry is of strategi c importance as well. India is a signatory to the \nInformation Technology Agreement (ITA-1) of WTO and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with \nvarious countries/ trading blocs such as ASEAN, Kor ea and Japan. However, the electronics \nhardware manufacturing sector faces lack of level p laying field vis-à-vis competing nations on \naccount of several disabilities which render domest ic electronics hardware manufacturing \nuncompetitive. These inter-alia include lack of adequate infrastructure, domestic supply chain and \nlogistics; high cost of finance; inadequate availab ility of quality power; inadequate components \nmanufacturing base; limited design capabilities and focus on R&D by the industry; and \ninadequacies in skill development. \n \n1.2. Building India’s capacity in core technology develo pment (Design and Intellectual Property (IP)) \nrequires deeper consideration. It is noteworthy tha t standards development, product design or IP \ndevelopment (semiconductor/ systems) and semiconduc tor manufacturing are increasingly \nbecoming important and improving India’s participat ion in this league must be a major priority for \nthe country, at least from the national security an gle. In the case of building Design and IP based \ntechnology companies, the large investments needed and difficulty in competing with established \nMultinational Corporations (MNCs) is a significant barrier. Building semiconductor fabrication \ncapabilities in India is essential to break into th is segment. \n\n¹Hkkx Iµ[k.M 1º Hkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k 17 \n1.3. Recognizing the electronics sector’s unique dynamic s, significant opportunities, and structural \nchallenges, the Government of India notified the Na tional Policy on Electronics in 2012 (NPE \n2012), which provided a road map for the developmen t of electronics sector in the country. The \nPolicy is holistic, investor-friendly and market-dr iven, and focused on upgradation of \ninfrastructure, providing incentives to offset disa bilities, promoting innovation and human resource \ndevelopment. Schemes such as Modified Special Incen tive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) to provide \nfinancial incentives across the ESDM value chain to compensate for cost disability in \nmanufacturing; Electronics Manufacturing Clusters ( EMC) for providing world-class infrastructure \nand logistics; mandating safety standards; rational ization of tariff structure and providing \npreference to domestically manufactured electronic products in Government procurement under \nthe aegis of the Public Procurement Order 2017, are under implementation. As a result, ESDM \nindustry has witnessed significant upward growth in India and has the potential to become a \nvehicle of economic growth and development. \n \n1.4. The Modified Special Incentive Package scheme (M-SI PS), launched in 2012, provides capital \nsubsidy of 25% for electronics industry located in non-SEZ areas and 20% for those in SEZ areas. \nUnder M-SIPS, 419 investment proposals involving in vestment of INR 1,13,089 crore have been \nreceived till 31.12.2018. Out of these 419 applicat ions, 197 applications with proposed investment \nof approximately INR 41,791 crore have been approve d; 19 applications with proposed investment \nof approximately INR 14,764 crore have been recomme nded by the Appraisal Committee for \napproval and 203 applications with proposed investm ent of INR 56,534 crore are under appraisal. \nOut of 197 units which have been approved, 134 unit s have commenced commercial production. \nTotal capital investment reported by these companie s is INR 9,961 crore. These 134 units have \nreported total sales of INR 74,921 crore, out of wh ich goods worth INR 16,418 crore have been \nexported. The revenue paid to the Government on pro duction by these units is INR 9,020 crore. As \nper Quarterly Progress Reports received from approv ed applicants, employment generated by these \nunits so far is 66,555 (direct and indirect). \n \nThe Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme , also launched in 2012, encouraged \nentities, including State Government entities, to p rovide good quality infrastructure within a \ncluster. Under the scheme, 50% of the project cost for Greenfield EMC and 75% for Brownfield \nEMC is given as grant. So far, 20 Greenfield EMCs a nd 3 Brownfield EMC projects have been \nsanctioned with the project outlay of INR 3,898 cro re, including INR 1,577 crore from the \nGovernment of India as Grant-in-aid. Under this sch eme, 3,565 acres of land is being developed in \nElectronics Manufacturing Clusters with likely inve stment of about INR 54,836 crore by the \nmanufacturers. \n\n18 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [P ART I—S EC . 1)] \nIn order to promote startups and innovation, a sche me called Electronics Development Fund (EDF) \nwas launched. EDF is a Fund of Funds which invests in Venture Funds, which in turn invests in \nventures/ Startups in the area of Electronics, Nano -electronics and IT. At least 50% of the corpus \nhas to be invested in Ventures working in ESDM sect or. EDF will be investing in 13 Daughter \nFunds. The total targeted corpus of these 13 Daught er Funds is INR 6,950 crore and the amount \ncommitted by EDF to these 13 Daughter Funds is INR 857 crore. \n \n1.5. The global electronics production is estimated to b e USD 2 trillion (approximately INR \n1,30,00,000 crore) in 2017. Indian electronics hard ware production has increased from INR \n1,90,366 crore in 2014-15 to INR 3,87,525 crore (ap proximately USD 59 billion) in 2017-18, \nregistering a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 26.7%, as against a growth rate of 5.5% \nin 2014-15. India’s share in the global hardware el ectronics production is about 3%. The share of \ndomestic electronics production in India’s GDP is 2 .3%. The import of electronic goods was of the \norder of USD 53 billion (approximately INR 3,44,500 crore) in 2017-18. With the demand for \nelectronics hardware expected to rise rapidly to ab out USD 400 billion (approximately INR \n26,00,000 crore) by 2025, India cannot afford to be ar a huge foreign exchange outgo on import of \nelectronics alone. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the electronics sector. \nOpportunity to be a global leader and challenge to address a severe Balance of Payments (BoP) \nproblem, which cannot be addressed by manufacturing for India alone. This calls for measures to \npromote large eco-system for domestic manufacturing , a special emphasis on exports and \nincreasing domestic value addition. Specific policy initiatives are required to meet these objectives. \n \n1.6. The production of Mobile Handsets, LCD/ LED TVs and Light Emitting Diode (LED) Products in \nthe country has gone up significantly, and over the last few years, the demand of these electronic \nproducts is increasingly being met out of domestic production. The production of LCD/ LED TVs \nhas gone up from 0.87 crore units in 2014-15 to 1.6 crore units in 2017-18. The production of \nLight Emitting Diode (LED) Products has gone up fro m INR 2,172 crore in 2014-15 to INR 9,630 \ncrore in 2017-18. However, the value addition conti nues to be low in the absence of a vibrant \ncomponents manufacturing ecosystem in the country. The Phased Manufacturing Programme \n(PMP) for mobile handsets and related sub-assemblie s/ components manufacturing has been \nimplemented with the objective of progressively inc reasing the domestic value addition for \nestablishment of a robust Cellular mobile handsets manufacturing eco-system. As a result, India \nhas rapidly started attracting investments into thi s sector and Cellular mobile handsets \nmanufacturing has emerged as a flagship sector in t he electronics manufacturing space. In \n2017-18, the production of Cellular mobile handsets reached approximately INR 1,32,000 crore, \ncompared to INR 18,900 crore in 2014-15. Production of Cellular mobile handsets in volume terms \nreached 225 million (22.5 crore) units in 2017-18, as compared to production of 60 million \n\n¹Hkkx Iµ[k.M 1º Hkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k 19 \n(6 crore) units in 2014-15. As many as 268 manufact uring units for Cellular mobile handsets and \ntheir parts/ components have been set up in the cou ntry during the last 3-4 years, resulting in \nestimated employment for about 6.7 lakh persons (di rect and indirect). \n \n1.7. Implementation of the Schemes/ Programmes under the aegis of NPE 2012 has successfully \nconsolidated the foundations for a competitive Indi an ESDM value chain. The Government now \nseeks to build on that foundation to propel the gro wth of ESDM industry in the country.

Guidelines for managing IPRs: \n \n1. The IPR arising out of sponsored project(s) will be with grantee institution(s). While \nthe patent may be taken in the name(s) of inventor(s), the institution(s) shall ensure \nthat the IPR is assigned to institution(s). In cases where the funding/resourcing of \nresearchers have been done jointly with other organizations, the IP rights would be \nappropriately shared among them. \n \n2. The Government of India/Govt. bodies ( includingits PSUs, Govt. autonomous\nsocieties & section 25 companies) shall have right to obtain a royalty-free license for\nthe Intellectual Property for deployment/use of the same for non-commercial\npurposes. However, in case, IP is proposed for commercial usage, the terms of \nlicensing may be mutually agreed with the grantee institution(s) possessing IPR. \n \n3. The grantee institution shall submit the financial requirements for filing of IPR as part\nof the R&D proposal. The contingency headcould be used for provisioning ofthe \nexpenditure for filing of IPRwith a ceiling ofRs. 15 Lakhs for the cost of initial filing, \nbut excludingfor the annuity fee. International Patent filing will be permitted. The\namount will be releasedbased on the recommendations ofPRSGconstituted by DeitY\n\nfor the concerned project. If, for any reason, it is not possible to meet the expenses \nfrom the project grant, like in the case of the need for filing of IPR arising after the \nclosure of the project, an application may be made separately by the institution to \nDeitY for sanction/ reimbursement of the expenses incurred in filing of the IPR. \n \n4. Thegrantee institution shall inform DeitY about the patentsfiled/obtained and IPR\narising out of the R&D project on annual basisover the project duration and\nsubsequent 5 yearsperiod after the project closure. \n \n5. The grantee institution shall provide information to DeitY about trading/ selling/\ntransferring /licensingthe IP rights, within a period of 6 weeks from conclusion of the \nagreement relating to such a commercial event. \n \n6.

The grantee institution shall constitute a Transfer of Technology (ToT) Committee for \nevaluation of the applications for ToT and for working the appropriate revenues \nexpected out of the ToT \n \n3. Prior to seeking the expression of interest for technology transfer/commercialization, \nthere should be sufficient disclosure of the technical details, features and capabilities \nof the project through advertisement, publication on the websites of the Institution and \nof DeitY, and exhibitions, if any held on the related themes during the relevant period. \nThe ToT proposal may be given wide publicity in one national daily besides in \njournals relating to the theme and by writing to the industry associations related to the \ntheme. \n \n4. Normally, a period of 6 weeks shall be given for interested parties to file their\napplications relating to Expression of Interest and a format for the application is \n\nattached in Annexure-I which may require customization based on the \ntechnology/product/service/prototype proposed to be transferred by the grantee \ninstitution. \n \n5. The ToT Evaluation Committee shall undertake a techno-commercial evaluation of the \nproposals received, adopting a 2-stage process. \n \n6. The ToT committee formed by the grantee institution will work out the cost of ToT\non case-to-case basis considering the ground realities like i) development cost of the \nproject ii ) market demand of the technology/product iii) ability of the industry to pay \nfor the technology iv) work involved from prototyping to packaging. The cost of \ncapital equipment will be excluded from the total cost of development. Such an \nestimated cost shall be used as the Internal Bench Mark (IBM) for evaluating the ToT\nfee and royalty, in Stage 2. \n \n7. After due diligence by the ToT committee a technology transfer/ licensing agreement \nshall be signed which shall include license of IPRs through existing legal procedures. \n \n8. It is desirable that technology be transferred on a non-exclusive basis. Exclusive \nlicensing should be in the rarest of rare cases based on sufficient justification by the \nToT Evaluation Committee and approval by the Head of the institution/ Competent \nAuthority and with the approval of DeitY. \n \n9. The institution is permitted to retain the benefits and earnings arising out of the \ntechnology transfer/ licensing of IPRs for ploughing back to pursue research/ in related \nareas. \n \nIX. Guidelines for publication of results \n \n1. Investigators wishing to publish technical/ scientific papers based on the research \nwork done under the project, should acknowledge the assistance received from this \nDepartment and a copy of the communicated/published paper be sent to DeitY. \n \n2.

    "content": "Service Level Agreement \n1.Service Objective: \n1.1 The objective of the implementing agency is to provide a \ncentralized Messaging service to all employees working under \nthe different arms of the Government, both at the Central and \nState level that: \n Is efficient \n Is scalable and reliable \n Satisfies the security requirements of the Government \n Meets the needs of its users \n \n2.SLA Objective: \n2.1 The purpose of this Service Level Agreement is to clearly define \nthe levels of service which shall be provided by the \nimplementing agency to its users. \n3.Scope of Service Level Agreement: \n3.1 This document describes the standard level of service that would \nbe rendered by the implementing agency within the framework \nof Security, including performance criteria, availability of \nservices, acti on to be taken in cases of a service failure and \nresponse and repair times. \n3.2 The implementing agency reserves the right to change, update, \namend or modify this SLA at any time. Such changes will be \nintimated to the users. \n4.Additional Definitions \n4.1 For the purpose of this agreement, the following additional \ndefinitions are required: \n\n4.1.1 False positive - means a wrong classification of a \nlegitimate email message as spam or Malware by scanning \ntechniques and, as a result, interfering with its delivery. \n4.1.2 Known Malwa re - means malware which is detectable with \nexisting anti -virus software signatures known to the anti -\nvirus software used as part of the Service. \n4.1.3 Repair time - means the time within Office hours \nmeasured by the implementing agency between the \nimplementing agency receiving a notification of a failure by \nthe user and recovery of the Service by the implementing \nagency. \n4.1.4 Scheduled maintenance - means maintenance work \nperformed by the implementing agency to its own network, \ndata center, servers and resources. Imp lementing agency \nwill notify the users about the maintenance and the \nexpected time for service restoration will be notified on the \nwebsite. \n4.1.5 Service Availability - means the amount of time \nexpressed as a percentage during which the Service is \navailable for the user over a defined period. \n4.1.6 Service failure - means an interruption of the delivery of \nServices and Deliverables excluding Scheduled \nmaintenance. \n \n5.Service uptime Levels: \n5.1 The Messaging Services shall generally perform to the levels as \nset forth below: \n\nS.No Service Levels uptime Remarks \n1. Service Availability \n(per year) 99.9 % It may also be noted that in a \nsingle instance, in case of the \nprimary site is down for a period \nbeyond 60 minutes, the process \nof Disaster Recovery will be \ninitiated and service will be \nrestored from the DR site. The \nservice will be restored within \n45 min utes from DR initiation. \n2. Mail delivery 100 % This does not include mails with \ninfected attachments/ message \nsize exceed/ disallowed \nattachment type/blacklist \nsender address/ blacklist IP \naddress/Mail from an open \nrelay/ any other violation of the \nmessaging usage policy \n3. Time within which \nmail will be \ndelivered within \nthe same domain Within 5 \nminutes \n Implementing agency will make \nbest efforts to ensure instant \ndelivery. However, it does not \ninclude instances beyond the \ncontrol of implementing ag ency \nthat include large queue size \ndue to large attachment , DOS \nattack etc which results in delay \nin delivery. \n\n4. Time within which \nmail will be \ndelivered to \noutside servers Within 5 \nminutes mail \nwill be sent \noutside \nNICNET Implementing agency will ensure \nthat the mail is sent to the \ndestination server within 5 \nminutes however, Implementing \nagency will not be responsible for \nmail delivery to domains and \nrecipients outside NICNET under \nthe conditions mentioned in \nAnnexure E(1) enclosed with this \nSLA. \n5. Malware Detection 100% The gateway appliance has been \nconfigured with two well known \nAV scanners. As per security \npolicy, each desktop also has an \nAV scanner. Hence each \nmail/attachment is scanned with \natleast 3 scanners. \nImplementing agency will ens ure \nmalware detection of known \nmalware, for which signatures \nare available for the Anti -Virus \nand Spam scanners configured \nin the Messaging System. This \ndoes not cover zero day/targeted \nattacks. \n6. Repair Time According to the Operational SLA defined bel ow \n7. False Positive 0 % No mail is dropped as a result of \na false positive. Any mail \ndetected as a false positive is \n\nflagged as “Spam” and delivered \nto the users “Probably Spam” \nfolder. User needs to check the \nfolder once a day \n \n6.Operational SLA \n6.1 Operational SLA for Services would be defined in the following \ncategories: \nSeverity level : The severity level of a service call is defined by \nthe extent of impact the problem has on the overall \nperformance of the Solution \nS1- Very high severity: Complete failure of critical \nsystems, services, applications or Network All user base \nis impacted with the downtime. \nS2- High Severity: Application is not down but there is a \nserious problem affecting productivity of \nimportant/multi ple users \nS3- Medium Severity: Application is not down but there \nis an issue affecting a small number of users \nS4- Low Severity: Functionality enhancement and/or \nsupport for modifications or maintenance of source code, \ntraining documentation or user docume ntation. \n \n6.2 The list of typical events with the Severity level is given below. \nHowever, the event can be a single event or greater than all \nevents combined together, for a single user/ domain or \n\ncombination of all together and collectively known as the “total \nsolution”. \n6.3 In case of a total service shutdown due to any reason like \npower/flood/network collapse the service would be provided \nfrom the Disaster Recovery site.

Skill Pyramid for the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \nGiven that the industry would required a varied prof ile of skill sets, the following figure presents an \noverview of the profile of skill requirements as de rived from human resource requirements across \ndifferent sectors of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 45 of 49 \nFigure 22: Skill Pyramid for the Elect ronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\n Source: Industry inputs, IMaCS analysis \n \nThe skill pyramid, in summary, captures where th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry stands \nrelatively in terms of skills (a function of ac tivity, educational requirements, and amount of \n‘preparatory’ time required to inculcate a specifi c skill) as compared to all other industries. \nAs can be observed, ‘Skill Levels 2 and 3’ , have the highest incremental requirement of human \nresource. This indicates the requirement for persons trained in manufacturing, servicing, and sales \nfunctions in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. \n2.6. Emerging Trends in Electronics and IT Hardware Industry and \nImplications on Human Resource and Skill Requirements \nThe following are some of the emerging trends in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry: \n Increasing consumption and potential for production: The expected stead y increase in the \nPrivate Final Consumption Expenditure (PFC E) on Home Appliances, Recreational and \nEducation Services, both ranging between 13% and 15%, is expected to drive the \nconsumption and production of Electronics and IT Hardware. This is expected to drive \nindustry/production growth at about 17%, w ith major contributors being Computers, \nConsumer Electronics, and Telecom. \n Sales and Service Ecosystem as a driver of employment: The sales and service support \nfunctions are expected to generate an incr emental employment of 1.2 million persons till 4% to 5% Skill Level 4 (skills which are \nhighly specialised involving \nresearch and design) \nSkill Level 3 (skills which require long drawn \npreparation as demonstrated by acquisition of \ndegrees, and involve highly technical or \nil i )\nSkill Level 2 (skills which require technical \ntraining inputs, knowledge of complex operations \nand machinery, skills of supervision) \nSkill Level 1 (skills which can be acquired with a \nshort/modular and focussed intervention and thereby \nenhancing employability of those with minimal education) 49% to 50% \n25% to 27% \n19% to 21% \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 46 of 49 \n2022. This would be due to a large nation-wi de footprint of tier-2 and tier-3 industry \nparticipants (dealers, franchisees, service agenci es, etc.). This ‘ecosystem’ would contribute \nto a large portion of the human resource requirement. \n Manufacturing has potential for increasing localisation: While a large portion of \nmanufacturing is actually currently a combination of sourcing and assembly, increasing content would be locally manufactured – for example, passive components, certain active \ncomponents, more complex motherboards, increasing adoption of Surface Mounted \nTechnologies and other high-tech areas. Certai n components such as CRT based picture tubes \nmay eventually see a reduction in production given the increasing adoption of LCD/Plasma \ndisplays. Incremental employment in manufacturing is likely to be 1.5 million till 2022. \n Increasing adoption of E-Waste Management (electronic waste management) driven by \nregulation is likely to see more ‘organi sation’ of the industry in that space. \n Global trends such as green and energy efficient t echnology is likely to have increasing \nadoption in India too. \n Increasing contract manufacturing an d stronger OEM-supplier relationships would also be \na key success factor towards developing a bette r ecosystem. There is a strong case for cluster \ndevelopment in this sector. \n Growing segments would be major contributors to employment: Segments such as \nConsumer Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecom Equipment would be major contributors for \nemployment. Illustrative growth categories are: \n• Set Top Boxes \n• Mobile Handsets \n• Plasma/LCD TVs \n• PC assembly \n• End to End IT solutioning - assembling, inst allation, support at on-site and off-site, \ninfrastructure management, emergence of newer technologies such as cloud-computing. \n2.7.

    "content": "No-15035/4/2021/AU -HQ \nUnique Identification Authority of India \n(Aadhaar Usage Division) \nUIDAI HQs, \nBangla Sahib Road, Behind Kali Mandir, \nGole Market, New Delhi. 110001 \nDated: 31stOctober, 2022 \nCIRCULAR \n \nSubject: Usage of Aadhaar - Do’s & D on’ts for Offline Verification Seeking Entities ( OVSE s). \n \nOffline verification is the use of Aadhaar for carrying out identity verification and KYC \nprocess es locally, without connecting to the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) of UIDAI. \nThe organizations cond ucting offline verification of an Aadhaar number holder for a lawful purpose \nare termed as Offline Verification Seeking Entities (OVSE). [Ref. Section ‘2 - Definitions’, Aadhaar \n(Authentication a nd Offline Verification) Regulations ] \n2. There are two modes of offline verification, viz the Secure QR Code (displayed on Aadhaar \nletter, e -Aadhaar, Aadhaar PVC card and m -Aadhaar ) and the Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC \nXML (downloaded from the UIDAI website and m -Aadhaar ). Both the Secure QR Code and the \nAadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC XML contain the resident’s data that is digitally signed by UIDAI. \nThis is an essential security component that establish es the authenticity of the document , as \npresented by the resident seeking service from an OVSE. Scanning of secure QR code ( which \nincludes validation of UIDAI’s digital signature) is possible using Aadhaar Secure QR code scanner \napplication. This scanner application is freely available for both Android and iOS based mobile \nphones as well as Wi ndows based applications . The scanner is also available as part of UIDAI’s m -\nAadhaar mobile application , for both Android and iOS phones . \n3. Resident s may voluntarily use the Aadhaar number for a lawful purpose, to establish their \nidentity by way of offline verification by an OVSE. For the purpose of offline verification by an \nOVSE, the Aadhaar number holder may use his/her Aadhaar either in (i) the physical form like \nAadhaar letter (or copy thereof) or printed e -Aadhaar or Aadhaar PVC Card; or in (ii) the electronic \nform like e -Aadhaar/ Aadhaar Paperless Offline e -KYC (XML)/ mAadhaar. \n4. Following are the Dos and Don’ts to be followed by the OVSEs: \n(A) Dos:- \ni. Be courteous to residents. Assure the resident about the security & confidentiality of their \nAadhaar being used for offline verification . \nii. Be sure to carry out offline verification of Aadhaar (as per para 2 above) prior to accepting i t \nas proo f of identity. This applies to all modes o f offline usage of Aadhaar, ie. secure QR \nCode on Aadhaar Letter (or copy thereof) / e-Aadhaar/ m -Aadhaar or in the Aadhaar \nPaperless Offline e -KYC (XML ), as the case may be . \n\n2 \n \niii. Carry out o ffline verification of Aadhaar only for the lawful purpose specified to the Aadhaar \nnumber holder along with his/ her explicit consent for verification taken either in physical or \nelectronic form . Maintain logs/ records of the consent for any future audit by UIDAI or any \nagency thereof. \niv. Provide the resident, desirous of availing any service from OVSE, other viable alternative \nmeans of identification, in addition to Aadhaar, as required for rendering the service. \nv. Ensure that Aadhaar data collected is not shared with any entit y except in accordance with \nthe Aadhaar Act and/or regulations thereof. \nvi. Ensure that no service is denied to any resident for refusing to or being unable to undergo \noffline verification of Aadhaar provided that the resident is able to identify himself/ herself \nthrough other viable alternative means, as suggested by the OVSE. \nvii. Ensure full cooperation to the Authority, or any agency appointed or authorized by it or any \nother authorized investigation agency, in case of any fraud investigation involving Aadhaar, \nviii. Do inform the Authority and the Aadhaar number holder, without undue d elay and in no case \nbeyond 72 hours after having knowledge of misuse of any information or systems related to \nthe Aadhaar framework or any compromise of Aadhaar related information. \nix. Ensure strict compliance to the Aadhaar Act and R egulations and to any ot her directions \nreceived from UIDAI from time to time, with respect to obligations of OVSEs. \n(B) Don’ts: - \ni. Do not accept Aadhaar number, in physical or electronic form, as a proof of identity for a \nlawful purpose, without first verifying the digital signature of the Authority as provided in the \nAadhaar Secure QR Code on Aadhaar Letter or e -Aadhaar or m -Aadhaar or Aadhaar \nPaperless Offline e -KYC (XML), as the case may be. \nii. Do not perform verification of Aadhaar without explicit consent of the Aadhaar number \nholder in the form & manner as prescribed. \niii. Do not perform offline verification on behalf of any other entity or person. \niv. Do not collect, use or store Aadhaar number or biometric information of the resident after \nhaving conducted offline verification of Aadhaar. Post verification, if the OVSE finds it \nnecessary for any reason, to store a copy of Aadhaar letter/ e-Aadhaar, the OVSE must ensure \nthat Aadhaar number is redacted/ ma sked and irretrievable t hrough any means by any entity, \nincluding by OVSE itself. \n \n--------- Sd/------- \n(Kuldeep Singh) \nAsstt.

I was given the huge responsibility to head this Task Force, comprising esteemed members from across the Indian ICTE value chain representing various Associations and leading Companies. \nThis has been the first-of-its-kind of a joint DIT-Industry initiative setup in the spirit of co-operation. The task before \nus was to chart a vision for the industry and recommend a suitable strategy for sustaining and developing all segments of the value chain of the ICTE Sector in India for the next five years and beyond with concrete and implementable recommendations/action points as also for making the industry globally competitive. \nWhile drafting the report, a well-rounded analysis, not just of the various verticals of the industry, but also by size \nof the industry i.e. small, medium and large was kept in mind. The Task Force also looked at how IT could proliferate into rural India for an inclusive growth. \nWe also closely looked at the multi-faceted dynamics of the industry including ensuring a healthy eco-system for the \nIT/electronics industry with equal focus on exports and domestic market development; focusing on social inclusion, especially the youth; changing the industry mindset from business models based on tax arbitration to one based on inherent strengths and increased value addition especially for products designed and made for India; standardising various aspects of applications and products; facilitating conducive environment for development/adoption of standards; gauging the requirements of the strategic sector for ICTE as also new products/application development; and strengthening the electronic component base as well as attracting new investments in the area. \nTo fructify these visions, the Task Force further constituted three sub-groups namely, Software & Services; Electronics \nSystems Design & Manufacturing (ESDM); and the Strategic Electronics to come out with insights on these crucial sub-sectors of the ICTE value chain, while keeping issues such as infrastructure, domestic market development, employment generation, exports, impact of international agreements & transactions particularly in mind. I must thank my colleagues Mr B V Naidu, Mr Som Mittal and Mr Kiran Karnik for providing leadership to these sub-committees respectively. Further, the contribution from all the members of our taskforce as well as several of the industry leaders has helped us put the industry issues in the right perspective. I must also acknowledge the significant contribution of M/s Ernst & Young for their efforts and support in researching and compiling the reports on ESDM as also M/s McKisnsey & Company for the reports on Software and Services and the Strategic electronics. Lastly, this report could not have been completed without the guidance and support of Mr R Chandrashekhar, Secretary, Department of IT , Ministry of Communications & IT and his team of able officers. \nAfter months of strenuous efforts of each of the Task Force members, I am happy to place in your hands the final report \nof the task force. I am confident that the recommendations will lead to actions by the Government and the industry alike and pave the way for India to become a dominant player of ICTE in the world in the not so distant future. \n- Ajai Chowdhry, Chairperson \n1 December 2009 \n\n2Task Force \nTask force to suggest measures to stimulate the growth of IT , ITES and Electronics Hardware Manufacturing Industry \nin the country \n1.

Shri Vinnie Mehta, Executive Director, MAIT Member-Secretary\n\nMessages\n\n\u0018Vision \nIs there a mantra to propel India to the league of developed nations? \nIndia’s technological prowess can provide the much-needed wind to her sails for the arduous economic and social \ntransformational voyage. \nWhile we have been very successful in IT/ITES exports, however, \nmomentum alone does not characterize leadership. We must build on this initial success with the next level of aggressive growth in other domains of technology including electronics hardware systems and design. India needs to leverage its market size and identify market mechanisms and policy interventions for increasing its dominance of key verticals like IT hardware systems, telecom, consumer electronics, defense and strategic electronics. \nThe need of the hour is to focus on building technology brands and IPs emerging out of India. We must target emerging \nmarkets and future technologies to capture market share and mindshare. \nLeveraging technology for citizen empowerment can also bring about India’s social transformation. One needs to \nponder that in this age when success is defined by one’s ability to connect with systems, people and opportunities, why are the poor really poor? Is it that the digital divide is actually denying access to education, life skills and livelihood opportunities to keep them poor in a virtual age when physical infrastructure ceases to be a barrier? \n“We have to democratize learning,” says C K \nPrahalad, Paul and Ruth McCracken Distinguished University Professor at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. This would happen only if we democratize access. ‘Access for all’, as in ‘education for all’ should be a fundamental right of every Indian citizen; it is only though democratisation of information that we can empower the vast majority of our people, fundamental to all this is the need to create access to broadband, which due to its inherent capability to substitute all other physical means of access across borders of every kind. \nMuch of the success in IT/ITES was due to favourable government policies, and the sector’s ability to actively capitalise \non the business opportunities. Now, there is an opportunity to create an inflexion point for each of the segments of the IT industry, to grow and to make a positive impact on the inclusive growth agenda of the country. \nIf we do not take decisive action today, we may miss the bus forever. In addition to the opportunity cost of potential \nloss of GDP and jobs, there is a huge strategic risk of dependence on competitor - nations for this high-tech and vital sector. Our success in IT/ITES would never be complete and would not touch the lives of masses without commensurate growth of electronics sector. Composite and integrated growth of both sectors – software and hardware, is the only route to make India a global technology powerhouse, which is the V ision of this report.u India should aspire to be a global \nICTE powerhouse in its true sense. \nu IT/electronics industry can be one of the largest and fastest growing industries in Indian economy and contribute significantly to the GDP and employment. \nu IT/electronics exports have the pote-ntial to offset Oil import bill.\nBroadband should be available on ‘tap’ – like water & electricity. \nThis should lead to \nu Access to Information (Search) \nu Access to Transactions (Pay per use applications, computing etc.) \nu Access to Interactivity (Social networks, exchanges etc.) \nVision 2020\nAccess Digitization Education Healthcare Energy Security\n\n\u0018Executive Summary \nIndia has a large, vibrant and fast growing economy and has a large number of ‘young people’ in the employable age, \nwhich gives it an edge over the aging economies. India also has a vast pool of trained, English-speaking personnel. It currently produces about 3 million graduates every year, out of which, approximately 500,000 are engineers and IT professionals and another 40,000 have post-graduate degrees & diplomas in business management. \nWe have seen remarkable success in the field of information technology and business process outsourcing over the \npast decade. Total export revenues earned by IT sector have grown to INR 212,500 crore (USD 46.3 billion) in 2008-09, at a CAGR of 35 per cent. IT-BPO sector too has grown to USD 12.4 billion in 2008-09, at a CAGR of 22 per cent. \nElectronics and strategic electronics are at a similar point of inflexion as the information technology IT/ITES industry \nwas a decade ago. The current demand for electronics in India stands at USD 45 billion and is projected to grow to USD 125 billion by 2014 and to USD 400 billion by 2020. Further, the exports are expected to increase from the current USD 4 billion to USD 15 billion by 2014 and USD 80 billion by 2020. \nICTE industry - electronic components, systems, telecom, software & services, and the strategic electronics sectors \nwith its multiplier effect has the potential to play a very significant and strategic role in India’s modernization, its socio-economic transformation and safeguarding its national and energy security interests. \nGDP growth is closely linked to increased exports, attractiveness of India as a manufacturing destination, FDI, \ncompetitiveness of our manufacturing units. Digitizing, IT and Internet penetration will empower the people of India to receive, absorb & act on information faster, thereby opening a plethora of opportunities for growth. \nThe report envisions transformation of India into a globally competitive nation with inclusive economic development \nby exploring opportunities in the ICTE sector and brings to light the challenges that need to be overcome. \nAs the world economy is poised for a transformation in the next decade driven by both global and country-specific \nfactors, in order to examine the challenges and opportunities that exist for the electronics and IT industry in India, some key attributes have been used as a “lens” to evaluate its positioning: \nMarket potential\nIndustry capabilities World class skills Regulatory environment Infrastructure and logistics Strategic need \nUsing the above framework the report attempts to provide strategic insights into the industry and the need to \nreinvent business propositions and offerings, that can help penetrate the global markets not only on value and cost factors, but also customised to their needs.

Executive Summary\n1.1 BackgRounD\nIndia’s success in the field of information technology and business process outsourcing over the past decade remains \nunparalleled. Total export revenues earned by this sector have grown from INR 6,723 crore (USD 1.8 billion) in 1997-98 to INR 212,500 crore (USD 46.3 billion) in 2008-09, a CAGR of 35 per cent. The domestic IT-BPO sector is showing increased traction, too, with growth from USD 1.4 Billion in 1997-98 to USD 12.4 billion in 2008-09, a CAGR of 22 per cent. India – through its unique value proposition – cost effectiveness, abundant talent and maturing service delivery, has emerged as the cornerstone for this sector, steadily increasing its market share to over 50 per cent of the global sourcing industry. It is estimated that India-based resources account for about 60-70 per cent of the offshore delivery capacities available across the leading multinational IT-BPO players. \nOver the last 10 years, the technology and BPO industry has been an engine of growth for the Indian economy. \nBetween 1998 and 2008, it quadrupled its share of India’s GDP and exports to 4 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. In addition, the industry has also had a strong multiplier effect on national GDP and consumer spending by way of capital expenditure, operating expenses and expenditure by the individuals employed in the industry .\n It has offset close to 65 per cent of India’ s cumulative net oil imports, strengthening India’\ns foreign reserves. \n It has helped expand tertiary education significantly; the top seven states that account for about 90 per cent of \nindustry have founded six to seven times more colleges than have other states. \n Between 1994 \nand 2005, the industry contributed up to 45 per cent of incremental urban jobs - including direct \nand indirect employment (~22 lacs directly and ~80 lacs indirectly).\n Focused on \nbalanced regional growth and is rapidly expanding into Tier 2/Tier 3 cities – currently operating out \nof 45+ locations.\n The industry \nhas set a precedent for talent practices in India through diversity, inclusive job environment, global \ncareer growth, and encouraged entrepreneurship and driven corporate social responsibility initiatives. \n It has \ncreated career opportunities for the youth in the country (70% of workforce is between the age of 26 to 35 \nyears). In addition, the focus has been on extensive training and development (entry level training, support for \ntertiary education, scholarships, sabbaticals etc).\n The industry \nhas enhanced India’s credibility as a business destination by forging relationships with 75 per cent \nof Fortune 500 companies, generating immense savings for customers (in 2008 alone, global sourcing savings for \ncustomers amounted to an estimated USD 20 billion), and promoting a focus on quality (65 per cent of all CMM Level 5 firms are based in India).\n It has \nbuilt the global brand for India as a knowledge economy. Global leaders, media and analysts have recognised \nthe potential for India through the brand built by this sector.\n IT enabled solutions have helped government and industry enhance governance and efficiency .l\nl\nllll\nl\nl\nl\nIndian IT-BPO industry revenues, Software and related services, FY98-FY09\nUSD Bn FY \n98FY \n99FY \n00FY \n01FY \n02FY \n03FY \n04FY \n05FY \n06FY \n07FY \n08 FY \n09CAGR\nExports 1.8 2.7 4.0 6.2 7.6 9.5 12.9 17.7 23.6 31.2 40.4 46.3 34.3%\nDomestic 1.4 1.6 1.9 2.5 2.6 3.0 3.8 4.8 6.7 8.2 11.7 12.4 22%\nTotal 3.2 4.3 5.8 8.7 10.2 12.5 16.7 22.5 30.3 39.4 52.1 58.7 30.3%\nSource: NASSCOM \n\n16The growth of the sector has led to tremendous pay-offs in terms of wealth creation and generation of high quality \nemployment. Direct employment in the IT services and BPO segment touched nearly 2.2 million by the end of FY2009. This also translates to the creation of about 8 million indirect job opportunities attributed to the growth of this sector in diverse fields such as commercial and residential real estate, retail, hospitality and transportation, etc.\nWhile the sector has maintained a CAGR of over 30 percent in the past decade, the global economic downturn has \nimpacted the growth trajectory of the industry which has declined to single digits in FY 2010. Industry analysts have estimated that the worldwide technology spending will decline by 3-5 percent in 2009 and being an export led sector with a key thrust on banking and financial services, exports are expected to grow by only 4-7%, domestic market by 15% leading to very limited new employment creation during the year. Along with the decline in global demand, many other low-cost countries are building a significant value proposition to challenge India’s leadership position aided by very enabling investment policies.\nThe industry in this phase has demonstrated maturity by reducing costs, focusing on new markets, investing in sales \nand development, domain expertise, enhancing operational excellence and thrust on customer centricity. However, continued support from the government is critical for the industry to retain its competitiveness and build for the next wave of growth.\nAs we look ahead, the industry recognises that the next 10-15 years will be fundamentally different from the past \nand driving the next wave of growth will require all the stakeholders to create an ambitious vision and focus on achieving that.\nOver the next decade, several global megatrends will shape the technology and BPO industry as they reshape the \nglobal economy. NASSCOM has carried out extensive research to understand the implications of the global megatrends and the changing global IT-BPO landscape (NASSCOM Perspectives 2020 report). The objective of this research was to identify opportunities that the industry can penetrate and provide strategic insights for the industry to reinvent business models and offerings that can transform global businesses through a well-defined customer value proposition. The research also articulates a vision for the sector to transform India through economic development and ICT-enabled solutions in healthcare, education, financial services and public services, which can drive the socio-economic inclusion of 30 million citizens each year. It also throws light on the opportunity at risk for the country and details a call to action for all the stakeholders — the industry, government and NASSCOM.\nHence with increased GDP growth of emerging markets, and shrinking working age populations, these megatrends \nwill present a new set of hitherto untapped opportunities that will include emergence of new verticals, service lines, geographic and customer segments. On the back of these trends, the addressable market opportunity for the IT-BPO sector is likely to expand from the current USD 500 billion to USD 1.5 trillion by 2020.\nIndia is fundamentally advantaged and uniquely positioned to sustain its global leadership position, grow its offshore \nIT-BPO industries at an annual rate of 13-14 per cent, sustain nearly 10 million direct jobs, and generate export revenues of about USD 175 billion by 2020 and domestic revenues of USD 50 billion by 2020. Additionally, this growth can be further accelerated to USD 310 billion through deep and enduring innovation by industry participants, and focused initiatives by all stakeholders.\nThis represents an opportunity, capable of catapulting us into a high growth orbit. The transformational impact \nthat this industry can achieve has the potential for India to not only achieve global leadership, but also build a truly inclusive growth environment in the country. Achieving these ambitious outcomes will require breakthrough collaboration amongst industry players, central and state governments, and NASSCOM – to ensure that appropriate actions required to maximize the global sourcing market potential and sustain India’s superiority as the preferred sourcing destination are executed in a timely manner.Software and Services Sector\n\n\u0018\u0018To that end, this note outlines the policy actions required in key areas such as 1) Developing high calibre talent pool \n2) Building Adequate Basic, Business and Social Infrastructure 3) Ensuring a Favourable Business Policy and Regulatory Environment 4) Global Trade Development and Actively Advocating Free Trade in Services 5) Catalysing growth in domestic market 6) Fostering a Sustainable Ecosystem for Innovation and R&D 7) Establish India as a trusted global hub for professional services - Managing Risks effectively 8) Harnessing ICT for Inclusive and equitable growth.\n1.2 REcoMMEnDa TionS\nWhile we have discussed the challenges and policy actions required in detail (section 5), there are some specific policy actions which need to be prioritized.

Of this, the market potential for services \nthat may be sourced globally was estimated at USD 500 billion. The total value of IT-BPO sourced from offshore \nlocations in 2008 was estimated at USD 89-93 billion.\nglobal offshore iT-BPo Market Potential \nWhile India holds a dominant share of the global offshore IT-BPO sector, yet, at USD 46.3 billion in 2008-09, Indian \nIT-BPO exports accounted for less than 2.8 percent of the global spend on IT-BPO. Over the next decade, the industry will be influenced by several global macro-economic, demographics, social, business and technological trends that \nwill shape the face of global business. These trends include:\nMacroeconomic and demographic trends\n Shifting centres of economic activity–GDP of Asia and Europe will converge\n Working age population shrinking in key developed countries (e.g., Japan, Italy, US)\nSocial and environmental trends\n Increased Internet and mobile connectivity transforming the way people live and interact\n Rapidly increasing consumption and associated supply gap in key natural resources (e.g., oil, water) creating \nneed for resource efficiency and climate change solutions\nBusiness and technology trends\n Global economic crisis leading to major shift in industry structures and higher regulatory control\n Corporate boundaries being redefined (e.g., open innovation, extended supply chains, web of partnerships)\n Technology radically transforming the way traditional corporations and governments function\nThis \nwill lead to new opportunities for companies to capture new markets largely untapped so far. So far, the prime \nfocus of the global sourcing industry has been on core markets- large enterprises from North America, Western Europe \nand Japan in verticals such as BFSI, telecom, retail, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and travel. While these core markets will continue to grow over the next 10 to 15 years, driven by growth in the cost base, the industry will be \nredefined along four key dimensions:\nnew \nservices in core markets: There is still further growth potential (beyond the cost-based growth) even in \nthe core markets described above. The global sourcing industry has largely focused on cost reduction through \nreplication of processes in low-cost locations. Going forward, the industry can propose additional services to these core markets in three ways: 1) offer beyond-cost services, e.g., revenue enhancement, capital avoidance; 2) suggest integrated manufacturing and services solutions e.g., end-to-end development of new auto parts; and 3) redesign and transform processes, leveraging automation.\nnew \nverticals: Several verticals in developed countries, which have previously not globally sourced services, \nare expected to do so in the next wave of growth. Driven by the megatrends, at least four new verticals are \nexpected to emerge by 2020 (public sector, healthcare providers, media and utilities). For example, due to increased spending requirements on healthcare and pensions as a result of aging populations, the public sector and healthcare providers will increasingly depend on technology and services providers for solutions to reduce the cost to serve. Also, energy companies and utilities will look for solutions to monitor and optimise their carbon footprint in line with emission requirements.\nnew \ncustomer segments: Enabled by megatrends such as increased digital connectivity and the availability of \nnew delivery platforms, the industry can expand its influence beyond large enterprises to SMBs. The emergence \nof new service offerings and business models (such as SaaS) will also allow players to serve smaller enterprises in an unconventional but profitable manner. The industry can also offer direct business-to-consumer services (such \nas financial, healthcare and travel services) to the emerging class of well-connected retail consumers.l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\n\n20new geographies: As economic growth expands into new markets, Asia will bypass Europe as the second largest \ntarget market, led by India and China. On the back of greater adoption of technology and outsourcing by \nenterprises, BRIC markets will become a sizeable target domestic outsourcing market, with India and China \naccounting for almost 50 per cent of the opportunity.l\nBased on the four dimensions of growth outlined earlier, the total addressable market for domestic outsourcing and \nglobal sourcing is estimated to be USD 1500-1640 Billion by 2020, growing by 3 times over current levels. The growth in the addressable market by 2020 highlights several trends:\n An estimated \n80 per cent of the growth in the addressable market will come from segments that have not been \ntraditional markets for the industry\n The addressable market for BPO will exceed that of technology services by 2020\n The BRIC domestic outsourcing opportunity will rival that of core geographies\n Innovation can \ncreate an additional opportunity (around USD 200 billion for solutions and products in three select \nareas alone - namely climate change solutions, clinical research and mobile applicationsl\nl\nll\nAreas of Focus Drivers of India’s advantage\nEnergy efficiency and \nclimate changeSmart buildings (integrated BMS linked to outside environment, e.g., weather, light, smart HVAC, occupancy-based lighting)\nSmart grid solutions (user-level \nsmart monitoring, automated T&D monitoring, load)l\nlGrowing carbon credits market\nIncreasing domestic demand to reduce car-\nbon footprint (India’s carbon footprint from electricity generation will grow at a CAGR of 4%, double the global average CAGR of 2% from 2010 to 2020)\nImproving regulatory environmentl\nl\nl\nMobile applications Internet offerings like search, mail,\nmessenger on mobile platformSMS-based searches, applicationsMobile middleware solutions, roam-\ning applications, SMS gatewaysl\nlllLarge domestic market\nRobust local ecosystem of companies, value \nchain players and investors\nEstablished IT resource pool & development \ninfrastructurel\nl\nlSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Total addressable market for global sourcing and domestic outsourcing, 2020\nContd..Software and Services Sector\n\n21Areas of Focus Drivers of India’s advantage\nClinical research Target identification & validation\nLead generation & optimisationClinical development & trialsData management & statistical \nAnalysisl\nlllLower time-to market due to easy access to \nlow-cost, large patient pool\nAvailability of talent for high quality trials, data \nmanagement\nFavourable regulations, domestic market and \ninfrastructurel\nll\nThe outsourcing opportunity in climate change, mobile applications and clinical research could add over USD 200 \nbillion to the total addressable market.

As India rapidly grows into one of \nthe largest economies of the world, this will not only lead to the rise of personal consumption in the Indian middle class but also fuel the growth of several, large and global Fortune 500 companies of Indian origin. The increasing affluence of the Indian consumer and globalisation of Indian corporations will likely lead to increasing sophistication of domestic demand in product complexity, delivery flexibility and service levels. These trends will have significant impact in growing the size and scope of the domestic addressable market.\nAs Indian consumers and corporations rapidly adopt mobile phones, and Internet access and broadband connectivity \nexpand, there is likely to be a significant increase in spend on IT hardware, software and services. Finally, the biggest domestic opportunity in most sectors (e.g., banking, insurance, retail, telecom and healthcare) lies in tapping the opportunity to serve the billions of underserved at the bottom of the pyramid. India is likely to be the laboratory for disruptive innovations to serve these underserved segments at a price and performance profile that \nsuits these conditions. Source: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020\nThe addressable domestic opportunity in India based on these megatrends is estimated to be USD 90-100 billion by the year 2020 and the industry has the potential to achieve revenues of USD 50 billion by the year 2020.\nIf the industry can achieve this vision, then by the year 2020, there will be a dramatically altered industry with more \ndiversified customer base, broad range of services, globalised talent pool and a portfolio of multiple co-existing business models.

Industry revenue growth can be further accelerated through deep and enduring innovation by industry participants, and focused initiatives by stakeholders to generate an additional US$125-135 billion in export revenue by 2020. \nAchieving these growth aspirations will entail a significant demand not only for human capital, but also significant \ninfrastructure and financial capital in the country. USD 175 billion in IT-BPO exports by 2020 translates to office infrastructure of 1 billion sq.ft, and direct capital investment of approximately USD 60-62 billion. \nThe following table illustrates the input requirements driven by the projected growth of Indian IT-BPO sector during \nthe period 2009-2020.\nThe Indian technology and BPO industry has contributed significantly to the Indian economy and society and can \nsustain and exceed this impact by 2020. Its contribution to Indian GDP can reach almost 10 per cent if the industry achieves its full potential. Further, it can create 30 million jobs by 2020, both in urban as well as rural and non-metro regions of the country. The industry can also foster India’s development by encouraging improved infrastructure and providing technology enabled basic services far more effectively and efficiently than today’ s traditional models.Software and Services Sector\n\n254. key constraints and challenges\nWhile India continues to be the dominant player in the global sourcing sector, its future will depend on how challenges \nto its continued competitiveness are tackled. The primary sources of risk are low employability, infrastructure constraints, rising costs, security concerns, discontinuation of fiscal incentives and a supportive policy framework and lack of an innovation ecosystem. In addition, the competition is intensifying and many countries are now positioning themselves as global sourcing destinations providing a plethora of incentives.\nRisks Implications\nRising costs Wage inflation at an average of 12% per annum in last few years and 10% in next \n5-10 years\nPublic infrastructure development costsl\nl\nDecline in talent \navailabilityLow employability of entry-level workforce\nHigh GDP growth increasing the war for talentDeclining willingness of people to work in industry l\nll\nCompetition from new \nlocationsEmergence of competing locations\nTalent enhancement in countries such as China, EgyptTargeting specific segments by rival locationsInfrastructure and policy support by competitive locationsl\nlll\nLow vendor maturity Indian vendors offer limited enhanced capabilitiesl\nInfrastructure constraints Industry concentration in few Tier I cities over-burdening infrastructure and \nInadequate infrastructure development in Tier II citiesl\nIncreased risk perception High currency volatility\nIncreasing geo-political risk l\nl\nAbsence of innovation \nenablersR&D spend at .85% of GDP is lower than in rival locations\nLack of institutional capabilities for academic research and hence low turnout \nof PhDs\nLack of enforcement of IP laws discourage research and technology \ncommercialisation l\nl\nl\nDeteriorating business \nenvironmentDiscontinuation of fiscal policies and diminishing regulatory supportl\nThe industry is putting together a number of initiatives to mitigate these risks but need sustained policy support from \nthe governmentSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020\n\n265. Policy actions Required\nThe following sections outline the policy actions required to address the concerns and challenges raised in the \nprevious section. \n5.1 MiTiga Ting ThE iMP acT oF ThE DownTuRn\nThe global economic recession has created an uncertain demand environment, one where there is reduced spending \non IT and BPO, but at the same time companies need to invest for the future into building competencies, expanding into new markets and focussing on innovation. Countries around the world have substantially invested in stimulus packages to support industry sectors and generate employment. The Indian government has also been supportive of the IT-BPO sector and has extended the tax incentives under Section 10A / 10B of the income tax act till March 2011. The following recommendations if implemented immediately can help the industry mitigate the impact of the downturn and contribute to India’s economic and social development.\nFiscal incentives: \nExtend the tax holiday under Section 10A/10B of the Income Tax Act to provide parity with the \nSEZ scheme. This is particularly required for the SME sector and tier 2/3 cities in the country, wherein the SEZ scheme will not be viable. The SME sector in India accounts for over 6000 companies but contribute to less than 10 percent of the industry revenues. Companies in India need an enabling fiscal regime, as they face issues of enhanced competition from other countries. The extension also needs to be done for a definite period ahead, as extension by a year, while useful, does not help to promote investment. The government also needs to correct the anomaly in Section 10AA of the SEZ Act with retrospective effect.\n Fa\nst track domestic spending: The National e-governance plan has allocated investments that need to be \nmade into key mission mode projects in the centre and state. It is critical that the government can fast-\ntrack implementation of all approved e-governance projects. This will help achieve the twin objective of enabling faster access to citizen services in the country as well as allow the industry to use its workforce for these projects.\naddress \nissues related to protectionism: As unemployment has increased in the US and UK, many bills are being \nintroduced in these countries that can possibly impact India’s business. These relate to specific changes in the \nUS H-1B and L-1 laws and immigration policy in the UK. It is imperative that the government at the highest level raise these issues and help address them.\n Transparent and stable policy framework with defined implementation: In the last two years, India is \nincreasingly being perceived as a difficult place to do business. While other competing countries are enhancing \nincentives and creating a pull for attracting investment, India’s changing or different interpretations to tax laws, labour laws, state laws is leading to a push away from India. It is imperative that a harmonious policy structure is created which is implemented uniformly across the country in a defined time-frame. \n Expedite structur\nal reforms in human resource development: It is important that while the focus on primary \neducation and `education for all’ is implemented, the government address the issue of structural reforms in \nhigher education that relate to accreditation system, faculty salaries, curriculum changes. \n i\nnclusive growth – help to develop a PPP framework: The industry in India is keen to partner with the government \nto enhance inclusive growth in the country. A well defined PPP framework across education, healthcare, financial \nservices and public services will enable the industry to develop the content, applications and process frameworks so that access for all is enabled.\n5.2 REaliSing ThE MEDiuM To long-TERM ViSion\nThe industry has the potential to reach revenues of USD 105 billion by 2014 and USD 225 billion by 2020. While the \nindustry will need to expand into new markets and build new competencies, it will not be demand constrained. The l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlSoftware and Services Sector\n\n27constraints on the supply side will need to be urgently addressed and a well defined implementation plan is needed \nwith clear milestones. \n5.2.1. improving the Supply and capacity of Suitable Talent \nIndia’s large talent pool is one of the key reasons for India emerging as a premier global sourcing destination. The demographic changes over the next quarter century will lead to evolution along fundamentally different directions for some countries. Some developing countries (e.g., India) will see an increase in their working age population (from 63 per cent in 2008 to 67 per cent in 2020) driven by relatively high birth rates and average life expectancy ratios. On the other hand, many developed countries (e.g., Japan, Germany, Italy) will see a declining working age population by 2020 driven by lower birth rates (8 births per 1,000 persons in Japan versus 23 in India) and higher life expectancy (82 years in Japan versus 69 in India). Even China will have a decline in the working age population (72 per cent in 2008 to 70 per cent in 2020). Hence by 2020, India will have the largest working age population in the world and therefore has the potential to have the largest pool of skilled workers in the world. However, with current levels of quality and scale in education, this tremendous opportunity could be lost. The government should make it a priority to significantly improve the quality and scale of primary and tertiary education in the country .\nThough India accounts for over 28% of the total suitable talent pool available to work in the IT-BPO sector across all the potential global sourcing low-cost locations, the proportion of graduates found suitable for employment is fairly low (quoted estimates range 10-20 percent). As a result the effective pool of employable graduates is far lower than the overall pool of people entering the working-age population. \nCurrently, any graduate who is hired, irrespective of the institute he comes from or his skill levels, is put through the \n16-week training (in areas such as technical skills, soft skills, company orientation and process-specific domain skills) when he joins the firm. It has been estimated that the industry spends a minimum of USD 1bn annually on this entry-level training. Recruiting a trainable pool is not a sustainable option going forward. Inadequate English-language proficiency and lack of soft-skills are the key gaps in the current graduate pool, reported by the industry . \nPolicy Action – Talent supply\n1. Introduce soft-skills program across universities in the country in partnership with the private sector. \n2. Requisite skills and competencies w\n.r.t. all levels of employment in IT and BPO space to be mapped.\n3. A credit based system for inter-operability between verticals and horizontal and vertical mobility to be \nintroduced. \n4. National \nstandard on employability assessment. Given the varying standard of different institutes, a common \nnation-wide benchmark for assessing students is necessary. The inclusion of industry needs in this assessment \nwill make it useful for recruitment. It will also ensure that colleges or training institutes include these specific elements in \ntheir curriculum. NASSCOM in partnership with the industry has created an assessment program – \nNAC for the BPO sector and NAC Tech for the` IT sector. These assessment programs need to be adopted as a national employability assessment across the universities in the country.\n5.2.2 Structurally Strengthen the Education System\nThe prevailing system of education in India is constrained by several factors. These include a lack of adequate \ncapacity and number of institutions acknowledged as sources of world-class talent; poor systems of accountability and lack of pressure to perform; operational inflexibilities, bureaucratic controls and complex governance structures shared between the centre and the state; teaching/academics not considered an attractive career option, leading to constraints on faculty resources; key stakeholders (i.e. the education system and the industry) operating in silos, with limited mutual interaction/participation.\nThe supply of graduates in India is growing at around 5 per cent a year. With a current average employability rate of \n26 per cent for engineering graduates and 10 to 15 per cent for other graduates and declining willingness to work in Policy Actions Required\n\n28the industry (from the current 80 per cent to 60 per cent in 2020 for IT and engineering graduates and 65 per cent \nto 45 per cent in 2020 for other graduates), the industry will face a talent shortage of over 2 million people by 2020 \n(1.5 million to retain current global sourcing market share, 0.8 million shortage in domestic market). The innovation market may lead to further demand of up to 1.2 million people including 300,000 PhDs. The government and the industry will have to take short-term and long-term initiatives to address the gap so that the industry is able to realise its full potential.\nThe Eleventh Plan allocation of around USD 6 billion (Rs 19,282 crore) for higher education is very low compared \nwith the anticipated requirement of over USD 55 billion (Rs 212,900 crore). One way to bridge the gap would be to encourage greater private participation in higher education. The government should address this situation by \nremoving regulatory restrictions on private investment and provide incenti ves to encourage investment.\nPolicy Action – Strengthening the Education system \n1. Under Graduate and Post Graduate programs to be ‘Credit’ based and standardized nationally. In addition allow \npolicy \nfor introducing electives and add-on programs (employment oriented) in colleges affiliated to universities \nto be less constrained and to be executed in a shorter period of time by all BOS (Board of Studies). \n2. Implement \nrecommendations made by the National Knowledge Commission on changes in the governance \nstructure in universities.\n3. The \nGovernment has drawn up plans to establish 20 new IIITs and 8 new IITs. These need to be implemented \nwith world class faculty and in partnership with the private sector.\n4. Address \ngap of 1,500 universities by upgrading top-performing colleges to affiliating universities and/or by \nestablishing Greenfield universities. \n5. New \ntechnologies of pedagogy, such as ICT, broadcasting, etc. must be introduced to provide wider access to \nhigh quality education, to overcome the shortage of teachers and to increase capacity. \n6. All \nnon-formal education courses/programs including apprenticeships programs, to be standardized across \nthe country for inter-operability; from the non-formal to the formal stream and from the unorganized to the organized sectors.\n5.2.3 national Faculty Development Program\n1. The Technical Education Quality Improvement programme (TEQIP), a Rs. 1550 crore World Bank funded initiative, \nis aimed at improving the quality of technical education in the country. TEQIP will address the major issues of selected institutes, like modernisation of laboratories and workshops, faculty and staff development, curricula improvements, course flexibility, interaction with industries, research, development of management capacity and networking of institutions for resource sharing. TEQIP-II type program to be made available to all 2000 engineering colleges\n2. National \nFaculty Development program in consultation with the industry, both for Engineering and non Engineering \ncolleges, for the short, medium and long term to be deployed \n5.2.4 indian Student Fund aid agency\nEncourage students and working professionals to pursue further education for skill enhancement by providing tax incentives. Set up a student financial aid agency (such as the Federal Student Aid in the US) for demand-based funding of tertiary education. The central government can set up the Indian Student Aid Agency (ISAA) on the lines of the FSA in US. This agency should be responsible for disbursing needs-based funding to students in the form of grants, loans and work-study (earn-while-you-learn) programmes. The dual objective of this scheme should be to ensure that no student is denied access to education because of weaker economic background and that enrolment in higher education reaches 40 to 50 per cent by 2020.\n5.2.5 Building Domain specialisation\nFurther, as highly skilled talent enters the workforce, the gestation period before new employees can generate revenues (up to six months for some players) will diminish and there will be a much greater focus on ongoing development of Software and Services Sector\n\n29specialised skills and capabilities. Career paths will become specialised, not only by domain expertise, but also by \nrole (e.g., solution architect versus client advisor versus programme manager).\nWhile some of the initiatives targeted at building capability in students and faculty, upgrading curriculum, our long \nterm objectives should be aimed at building skilled resources—Ph.Ds, and engineering graduates while sustaining and scaling the short- and medium-term initiatives.\n5.3 BuilDing woRlD claSS BuSinESS anD Social inFRaSTRucTuRE \nCurrently more than 90 percent of the industry revenues are from 7 cities in the country (Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, Kolkata and the NCR region). The infrastructure in these cities is heavily constrained – be it power, road, transport, residential accommodation and water supply. If the industry has to achieve the vision set up in the medium to long-term, there is a need to urgently address the infrastructure deficit in the country . \nIn addition, the imperative to focus on balanced regional growth will mean that locations apart from these 7 cities should account for at least 40 percent of the industry revenues by 2020 and the current hubs will need to increase by at least 2.5 times their current size.\nTaking into account the above facts, we will have to promote the creation of integrated physical and social infrastructure \nin 10-15 Tier-II and Tier-III cities (including new township development) with high potential to serve as hubs for the industry (i.e., provide basic infrastructure, social facilities). Real-estate requirements by 2020 are estimated to be between 2,000 – 3,000 million square feet.\nThe growth in population will require additional power and water supply, bandwidth, public transport and international \nair connectivity. Power and telecom needs alone will be as follows:\n Power: \nAdditional power of 4,000 – 6,000 MW for office and residential purposes will be required. Most cities \ntoday have a power shortage of 5 to 10 per cent in the peak season. This gap can be addressed through captive \npower plants in offices and by electricity generation through nuclear and wind energy .\n Telecom: \nThere is a reasonably high supply of telecom landline and mobile connections in Tier-II cities. The \nsupply and quality of high-speed bandwidth, which is the backbone of technology and BPO companies, will need \nto be improved. Increased bandwidth requirement will be 250,000 – 400,000 mbps\nPushing infrastructure development and developing new townships will call for a high level of collaboration between various stakeholders including the state and central governments and the private sector. A special nodal agency will be needed to coordinate efforts. Such an agency should be created in all states, responsible for driving infrastructure improvement in identified cities or new townships. Action will need to be taken across various fronts including: master plan development, model financial arrangements, land acquisition and auction, proper re-settlement of displaced \npersons, aviation and transportation planning, and educational linkages.\n5.4 EnSuRing a Fa VouRaBlE BuSinESS Policy anD REgula ToRy EnViRonMEnT \nA favourable business policy and a regulatory environment are critical for the success of any sector. The Indian \nGovernment’s proactive approach towards the IT-BPO industry over the past decade is showcased in initiatives such as l\nlPolicy Action – Domain Specialisation\n1. Launch and scale up technology and BPO specialisations across all vocational training institutes (Industry \nTraining Institutes/Industry Training Centres). Industry would continue to provide vertical specific training and \ncan carry out strategic acquisitions to facilitate that.\n2. Domain \nspecialisation needs to be built in research and education institutions; servicing the domestic demand \nwould also lead to building specilaisation.\n3. Increase number of PhD holders per million population by\n at least 5 times.Policy Actions Required\n\n30the IT Act Amendment, tax incentives, telecom sector deregulation etc. The role of the private sector in developing \nthe industry and providing it world-class facilities and services is also commendable.\nHowever, in the past year there have been concerns on the ambiguous and lack of consistent policy implementation \nin the country. Along with the sustained thrust from competing countries to attract investment through a plethora of incentives, there is an urgent need to address the policy environment from the perspective of investment, implementation and communication.\nKey policy changes wherein support is needed are:\n5.4.1 Extend ta x benefits under Section 10A/10B and provide parity with SEZ scheme\nThe tax incentives under Section 10A/10B of the Income Tax Act have enabled a policy framework wherein new \nbusinesses in the country have been able to reinvest their profits and build for the future. The companies have invested in world class facilities, extensive talent development initiatives, disaster recovery and power back-ups, transportation many of which are costs that companies in other countries do not incur .\nWith the economic downturn, small and medium companies are facing issues of clients closing down, delay in payments, inability to garner working capital requirement. At the same time they need to invest more in sales and development, domain specialisation and IP development. Continuation of tax incentives will enable this sector to redeploy their profits and manage the downturn. Also, the conditions under the SEZ scheme are not conducive to the small and medium companies. The parity with SEZ incentives is needed both for building a vibrant SME sector and tier 2/3 cities in the country where SEZs are unlikely to come up.\n5.4.2 Ensure implications of the Direct Tax code to be introduced in 2011 are not counter-pro-\nductive and meets its key objectives\nWhile the draft direct tax code proposes reduced tax rates for all taxpayers, it also proposes to remove most of the \ntax incentives that are available. The effective tax rate for companies is reported to be 22.24%. With tax incentives withdrawn, the ETR of corporates below the average would tend to increase to 25%. The IT and BPO sector (in short “IT services”) has an unprecedented and commendable track record of earning precious foreign exchange for India and generating employment, which continue to remain vital for India, given its balance of trade and its demography. India’s exports in 2008-09 were USD 168 billion and the export of IT services accounted for an impressive USD 50 billion. India, with its talent and competitiveness, has earned the distinction of being the most preferred destination for outsourcing IT services. Being a knowledge-based services sector, more than 50% of the costs incurred are by way of salaries paid to employees and payments for outsourced services, which has features of full tax remitted through withholding and payment of taxes by individuals at rates significantly higher than average rate. In any tax policy, these rank as the most preferred features as they ensure complete economy in collection and minimum tax gap. \nThe method of granting Foreign Tax Credit also needs to be addressed in the Code. Further, India has not, till date, \nentered into treaties with developed nations like the USA and UK for elimination of dual social security levies and as a direct consequence, provision of IT services, which requires significant deployment of on-site resources, entails incurring a significant social security taxes without securing any benefit. In these circumstances, the tax incentives granted to IT-BPO services should not be viewed as a revenue loss or tax foregone considering that the sector incurs many taxes for which credit is not granted by India and it contributes incrementally to the revenue by way of withholding taxes. \nFurther, the new draft tax code proposes a MAT based on gross value of assets. Any tax on capital formation for \nproductive purposes would be regressive irrespective of the positive the effect it will have in mobilizing tax revenues in the near term. The MAT proposed in the Code has a cascading effect, which makes the MAT levy inefficient. For new entrepreneurs with a vision of competing with established players, it is a tax on inflation, which in itself is an economic burden. It would be more regressive if there is no MAT credit that could be carried forward and set-off \nagainst normal tax in the future years as it would add to the aggregate tax on income. The current profit based MAT is Software and Services Sector\n\n31equitable in as much as it is imposed only on profitable companies and thereby meets the test of the “ability to pay” \nwhereas a MAT based on value of gross assets would be tax on the “ability to earn”. \n5.4.3 Enabling environment – review of indirect and personal taxation; other relevant laws\nStrengthening the overall policy framework is another key aspect of policy reform required to strengthen India’s \nIT-BPO sector. This is essential not only for strengthening India’s value proposition as a safe destination to do business, but also to encourage the growth of the industry.Policy Action – Direct Taxes \n1. Extend tax incentives Section 10A/10B and provide parity with SEZ scheme. Ensure these incentives can \ncontinue after the direct tax code is introduced. \n2. Address \nthe anomaly of Section 100 AA exemption with retrospective effect. The provisions of section 10AA of \nthe ITA on the computation methodology should be introduced in the same form retrospectively in the Code.\n3. Computation of MA\nT should be restored to profit based taxation.\n4. The new draft tax code aims to improve the efficiency and equity of our tax system by eliminating distortions \nin the tax structure, introduce moderate levels of taxation and expand the tax base. However many of the clauses are creating anomalies and ambiguities and it needs a comprehensive review and addressal by the government.\n5.5 gloBal TRaDE DEVEloPMEnT anD acTiVEly aDVoca Ting FREE TRaDE in SERVicES \nExpansion of the global IT-BPO market opportunity is directly influenced by the policy and regulatory frameworks \ngoverning cross-border trade in services. Growth of cross-border trade in services is constrained not only by tariff barriers – but more so by non-tariff barriers (e.g. national treatment in cross-border supply and movement of people). India must continue to work proactively with its trading partners (through the WTO and other trade promotion agencies) to streamline trade in professional services. \nIndia must push for the free movement of professionals engaged in delivering services on the basis of formal contracts, \nthrough a global GATS or professional services visa. It should counter protectionism by enhancing bilateral and multilateral agreements. It can pave the way for entry into the global market by proactively entering into agreements with governments in core and emerging markets to increase trade in services and the free movement of labour. At the same time, it must engage in bilateral or plurilateral negotiations on this with countries of specific interest to us. Negotiations are also needed to conclude agreements relating to exemption or refund of social security taxes paid by Indian professionals working abroad. \nThe medium to long-term vision of the industry envisages that 80 percent of the growth opportunities will come from \nthe non-core markets today, If India has to capture this opportunity, it requires a fundamentally different business model and initiatives both from the government and the industry.Policy Action – Indirect taxes; other relevant laws \n1. Union Budget for 2009-10 included provisions for creating a safe harbour regime for defining taxation for \nmultinational \ncompanies operating in India. This needs to be implemented on a fast track basis to enable MNCs \nto enhance their investment in India.\n2. Strengthen \n“offset policy norms” to include technology and BPO and leverage defence/nuclear and infrastructure \nspending.\n3. Resolve duplicity of indirect taxes for packaged software.\n \n4. Policies to address delays in refund of service tax.\n5. Creating a regulatory environment that is relevant from a service economy point of view. The current labour laws were drawn up at a time when India was mostly an agriculture/manufacturing based economy (e.g., not allowing women to work at night, maintaining tax returns in hard copies) with large part of labour within that sector. In the services sector, specially knowledge economy, the category of employees is different and hence nature of protection needed to be provided also needs to reflect the reality .Policy Actions Required\n\n32Increased government support in trade development programs for this sector can play an important role in expanding \nthe market for India. Today many companies, especially SMEs are constrained in their marketing efforts to lack of \nfunds and the size/base to drive their messages in new markets and geographies. \nPolicy Action – Global Trade Development \n1. India must push for the free movement of professionals engaged in delivering services on the basis of formal \ncontracts, through a professional services visa. Countries such as UK, Germany, France, Japan, already offer such visas and EU is working on short term work visa to cover entire EU territory.\n2. Need to counter protectionism on sustained basis through\n effective negotiation with key countries. \n3. Enhance bilateral and multilateral agreements (GATS) to encourage favourable immigration norms. \n4. Negotiate Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty and Totalisation Treaties for a conducive tax framework.\n5. Integrated communication and media campaign to promote India as a value added partner for IT-BPO services \nand products.\n6. Ease \nvisa norms for India and ensure that the process of getting a work visa for India is transparent and \nefficient.\n7. Market \nDevelopment Access of the government to build special thrust on emerging markets and SMEs to \nparticipate in global events.\n8. Build \nalliances with key countries to develop language programs that can be offered as electives in colleges or \nspecialised courses. \n9. Partner with industry in building research and market access information in emerging markets.\n5.6 FoSTERing a SuST ainaBlE EcoSySTEM FoR innoV aTion anD R&D\nInnovation will be a key requirement for success in the future. India has the potential to emerge as a leading hub of \ninnovation in low-cost technology and process reinvention. To realise this potential, the government and the industry can undertake several actions to transform the eco-system and create enablers of innovation. In the medium term, the government should focus on enhancing and enforcing IPR laws to match the best in the world. India already has strong IPR laws; they need stronger enforcement to encourage companies to commercialise in-house developed technologies and processes. In 2008, the World Economic Forum ranked India 48 out of 60 countries in IPR protection.\nFurther the government should catalyse investment in R&D to match the best in the world. Current spending on R&D in \nIndia amounts to 0.85 per cent of GDP , lower than in China (1.44 per cent) and Russia (1.77 per cent). A comparison of the number of researchers per million people across countries shows that India is lagging behind. The number of patents granted in India per million people is also lower than that in other emerging economies such as China, Brazil and Russia. \nA review of successful innovation hubs or ecosystems across the globe (such as Silicon Valley, Ireland and Israel) shows \nthat five enablers are required for sustained growth of an ecosystem.\nSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Software and Services Sector\n\n33The focus on developing an ecosystem of R&D and innovation will supplement the industry’s efforts to move up the \nvalue chain in terms of business model evolution and services provided. \nIn addition to developmental research, it is also necessary to build capabilities in new/emerging areas that are likely \nto grow in importance over the next few decades. At least three such opportunities have been prioritised: 1) climate change and energy efficiency solutions; 2) mobile software applications; and 3) end-to-end clinical research. India has a head-start in these areas due to existing infrastructure (e.g., clinical research) or market maturity (e.g., mobile market), or because they are sunrise areas with no clear market leaders (e.g., climate change). \nThe government can improve the innovation ecosystem by focusing on the following actions:\nPolicy Action – Encouraging Innovation & R&D \n1. 150% weighted tax exemption on in-house R&D expenditure in the Services (particularly IT) sectors. \n2. The \ndraft Innovation law proposed by Ministry of Science, Technology and Earth Sciences should be thoroughly \nexamined by the DIT from an ICT perspective. The focus should be on the various collaborative R&D scenarios \non IP ownership and revenue sharing models and using best practices, should arrive at a set of prescribed models that will be followed for each scenario. e.g for Industry-academia collaboration, industry-government collaboration etc. \n3. Thematic \nInnovation Clusters specifically for developing new and innovative solutions for mobile applications, \nhealthcare, climate change solutions, integrated design and manufacturing hubs for automotives. Identify 3-4 cities as emerging innovation hubs and build an integrated plan to develop and promote these.\n4. International \nCollaboration on R&D - Enter into bi-partite agreements with foreign Government institutions to \nensure that international research can be customised to an Indian content.\n5. Government, \nin consultation with Industry and Government bodies should put in place a mechanism to ensure \nthe rapid commercialization of (non-strategic) technologies developed in Government labs. This mechanism should ensure that companies, specifically SMEs which are developing similar/complementary technology are identified and collaborative work is facilitated. \n6. Investment \nin innovation infrastructure - There is a huge requirement for Measurement, Standardization, \nTesting and Quality centres across the country. This infrastructure requires substantial capital investment which is difficult for SMEs in particular, and sometimes even the large companies to bear. The government should create and collate these with premier education colleagues and allow industry to use on a pay-per-use basis.\n7. Encourage \nPPPs for R&D in sectors that have little private sector presence, such as defence, space and \natomic energy.\n8. The \ngovernment must create a fund to provide grants to SMEs for global patenting and copyrights. This is an \nexpensive process, and many SMEs do not have the funds to file global patents, thus losing their rights on the intellectual property created by them.\nWith rising energy costs, and a renewed consciousness towards the environment, Green IT has emerged as a strategic \nshift for the entire industry. As IT infrastructure across the world increases, more equipment translates to higher \npower consumption and space, hence if products keep consuming energy at previous levels this will have serious implications on nature. The Indian industry has responded with a set of initiatives that aim to reduce its carbon \nfootprint, and make it more profitable at the same time.\nPolicy Action – Green IT \n1. Standardization - There is a need for interoperable open standards for all the devices including networking \nequipments which is a prerogative of BEE and DIT. Need to standardize IT equipments and also set up \nbenchmarks for Data centers is required.\n2. Govt. \nProcurement - Government agencies should include the standards for energy consumption as the technical \nstandards in government purchases. And with establishment of mutually agreeable standards between BEE and IT industry it should be made mandatory in all the government purchases.\n3. Setting \nup Centre of excellence - Government of India should set up COEs (centre of excellence) in the \ntop technical institutions and Universities. These centers can become the testing grounds and prototype/pilot evaluation stages for the Green (Clean) technologies. \n4. T\nax Incentives - Investing in the clean technology is a costly affair when the organisation is an early mover/\nadopter.

Expansion to various delivery centers across geographies, complexity of work being outsourced, strong linkages to business outcome and tighter SLAs, compliance to complex regulatory frameworks of the home and the host country, data security and asset protection at each delivery center are some of the key reasons for the industry’s focus on managing its’ risks. The increased concern on terrorism, geo-political risks and the already large footprint of multinational companies in India, is increasingly raising concern on the risk profile of India and what steps are being taken to mitigate these risks. Government and the industry need to reinforce India’s reputation in the world markets and start positioning India as a “trusted sourcing destination”.\nPolicy Action – India as a trusted sourcing destination\n1. Develop a national security strategy and design a security organisation on lines of the US Homeland Security \nwith appropriate systems.\n2.

As India rapidly grows into one of the \nlargest economies of the world, this will not only lead to the rise of personal consumption in the Indian middle class but also fuel the growth of several, large and global Fortune 500 companies of Indian origin. The increasing affluence of the Indian consumer and globalisation of Indian corporations will likely lead to increasing sophistication of domestic demand in product complexity, delivery flexibility and service levels. These trends will have significant impact in growing the size and scope of the domestic addressable market. As Indian consumers and corporations rapidly adopt mobile phones, and Internet access and broadband connectivity expand, there is likely to be a significant increase in spend on IT hardware, software and services. Finally, the biggest domestic opportunity in most sectors (e.g., banking, insurance, retail, telecom and healthcare) lies in tapping the opportunity to serve the billions of underserved at the bottom of the pyramid. India is likely to be the laboratory for disruptive innovations to serve these underserved segments at a price and performance profile that suits these conditions.\nContrary to popular perception, Indian enterprises have significant legacy assets and have systematically invested in \ntechnology over the last 10 years. Two of the largest sectors, BFSI and telecom, which together contribute close to 50 per cent of the total addressable market, have already reached significant technology spend levels. For example, BFSI companies already spend 6.5 per cent of their revenue on IT , which is not far behind developed country benchmarks (e.g., US IT spend as a percentage of revenue in BFSI is 7.6 per cent).\nThe central and state governments have succeeded in the adoption of IT in several departments (e.g., Ministry of \nCorporate Affairs, Income Tax, Land Registry). These initial successes have created significant momentum for adoption of IT and IT-enabled public services across several departments (e.g., Healthcare, Education, Public Distribution Services, Unique Citizen ID).\nWhile the government has very well planned projects under the National E-Governance Program (NeGP), there are \na number of issues that impede fast track progress on these projects. The tendering process is elongated and not Software and Services Sector\n\n35conducive to needs of small players. In addition, there is no clear roadmap on outcomes and process specifications \nkeep changing. Also, the coordination between central and state governments is limited – same project being executed differently in different states.\nPolicy Action – Domestic Market\nu 150% tax exemption on R&D for the manufacturing sector to be extended to Investments by that sector in \nIT adoption. This incentive could be extended primarily to the SMEs and for adoption of green initiatives facilitated by technology adoption.\nu Program office under PMO to review and monitor e-governance. Clear directive to centre/states on implementation. Measurement to be outcome based.\nu Build central repository of e-governance solutions that can be used across states and other developing countries.\nu Put in place mechanisms that ensure that E - Governance initiatives are implemented faster and are outcome based. Focus on definite end points, delivery timelines and actual, demonstrable performance. Government should disburse funds in the form of a loan; once desired timelines and targets are achieved, it can be converted into a grant (e.g., restructured Accelerated Power Development Reforms Programme (R-APDRP)).\nu Focus on standardisation - encourage development of centralized frameworks, templates, architectures and if needed, applications; Build evaluation committees which has the competence and domain expertise and does not need replication in each department.\nu Allow reusability of solution that is developed in one state in another state.\nu Empanel the right size players for specific initiatives – large size for strategic initiatives and small size for others.

If India’s GDP continues to grow at 7 per cent a year, in 2020 the number of citizens in the high-income segment will rise to 52 million and in the middle-income segment to 372 million. The number of households in the low-income group will drop to 933 million. As a result, India has the potential to add around 4 million citizens every year to the high-income segment and 26 million citizens ever year to the middle-income \nsegment up to 2020.\nICT-enabled solutions \nin healthcare, educa-tion, financial servic-es and public services can drive socioeco-nomic inclusion of 30 million citizens each year, faster, cheaper and more effective-ly than traditional models. To achieve growth, India needs to address demand supply gaps in four key areas.Policy Actions Required\n\n36ICT-enabled solutions can overcome the difficulties that hamper traditional solutions. Analysis suggests that less than \n10 per cent of demand for outpatient visits in rural India requires face to-face interaction with a doctor. More than \n90 per cent could be addressed through a combination of trained paramedics and ICT-enabled remote sessions. ICT can enable a hub and spoke model to meet the needs of rural healthcare.\nThe chart above depicts a hub-and-spoke model for healthcare. It consists of an integrated hub in major urban centres \nhousing a pool of qualified doctors, a central electronic health repository and an ICT enabled mission control centre to track and monitor delivery of services through its various spokes. The spokes include a portfolio of services that help bridge the gap between urban and rural availability of infrastructure, skills and healthcare services. ICT-enabled solutions that enable remote access to remote doctors through electronic diagnostic devices and real-time video conferencing can offer not only access to quality advice but at a much lower cost to the patient (USD 1.1-1.31 per \n5 minute consultation).\nTraditional models in banking are based on business components that are not effective or efficient in addressing the \nneeds of rural or low-income segments. Examples of a few business components with associated challenges include:\nBank branches or ATMs: Too expensive to operate in sparsely populated areas\nCredit risk management systems: Not valid in data scarcity environmentsCentralised lending operations: Not possible in a low automation environmentManagement Information Systems (MIS) for transparency and accountability: Expensive investments required \nby small companies operating in rural and low income segments. A lack of automation also makes it difficult to implement the required MIS.\nl\nlllSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020Software and Services Sector\n\n37ICT enabled solutions can overcome challenges faced by traditional solutions in financial services\nSource: NASSCOM-McKinsey Perspective 2020\nIndia has made significant progress in education with respect to access and enrolment in the past decade, largely \ndriven by the government flagship programme in elementary education - the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). The number of schools increased by 40 per cent between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007, approximately 98 per cent of habitations have access to a primary school and 86 per cent have access to an upper primary school. The net enrolment ratio (NER) at the primary level stood at 92.75 per cent in 2006-2007 compared to 84.5 per cent in 2005-2006. Approximately 1.5 million teachers have been added to the system between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007 Nevertheless, five challenges remain in \neducation in India: performance, teacher capacity, teacher quality, administration and private participation.\nICT-enabled solutions can address four of the five challenges mentioned on the previous page:\n Pe\nrformance: Standardised online performance assessment of students will help in monitoring and assessing the \nperformance of students. Graded questions of progressively increasing complexity and a focus on understanding and \nanalytical thinking rather than on memorising facts can be created centrally and administered at rural school level.\n Teacher \ncapacity: Virtual classroom settings in which a teacher delivers online coaching to students in an individual \nor group setting can help increase teacher capacity. Students can be given access to CDs containing recorded \nlectures by faculty.\nQuality: Teacher training by a master teacher through interactive and instructor-led methodology will help \nincrease the quality of teachers. The quality of content can be improved by providing interactive, multimedia-\nbased content.\n Administration: An \neffective MIS can help improve school administration. Also, information availability at the \ncountry level will help in planning access to education for all.l\nll\nlPolicy Actions Required\n\n38ICT can overcome challenges faced by traditional models\nPolicy Action – Inclusive and Equitable Growth\nOffering ICT solutions for Inclusive growth\n1.

Executive summary\nBackgRounD\nElectronics, reported at USD 1.75 trillion, is the largest and fastest growing manufacturing industry in the world. It \nis expected to reach USD 2 trillion by 2014 and USD 2.4 trillion by 2020. Currently, the demand in the Indian market stands at USD 45 billion and is projected to grow to USD 125 billion by 2014 and USD 400 billion by 2020. Further, exports are expected to increase from the current USD 4 billion to USD 15 billion by 2014 and USD 80 billion by 2020. (Please refer to table in Appendix.)\nDomestic consumption is expected to grow exponentially at a CAGR of 22% for the period 2009–2020. This will be \ndriven by a surge in income levels, the aspirational value of electronics goods, demand from a resurgent corporate sector and the government’s focus on e-governance. Domestic production is at present less than 45% of domestic consumption. \nThere is a huge gap in the demand and supply which will widen as the demand grows and domestic manufacturing \ncontinues to slacken. Significantly most of India’s electronics imports are from China, Indian government may like to reckon this from a strategic perspective.\nchallEngES anD oPPoRTuniTy \nAs we realize that electronics industry in India is at cusp of a large and growing opportunity, we need to be mindful that there have been some missed opportunities in past decade. So while future holds a lot of promise, their still exist multiple challenges that can shackle growth of the industry such as inadequate infrastructure, tax structure, supply chain and logistics, inflexible labor laws, limited R&D focus, funding, limited focus to value addition and exports.\nSupply is not keeping pace with demand in India, which has resulted in ever-increasing imports into the country from \nChina and Taiwan. Local manufacturers cannot match the competitive prices of imported finished goods due to the challenges mentioned above.\nIn terms of opportunities, the electronics industry can significantly boost India’s GDP , generate employment, modernize \nprocesses and enable country’s inclusive growth.\nDomestic manufacturing companies can expand the production to USD 100 billion by 2014 and USD 400 billion by 2020 with a very significant contribution to GDP , at 20% for 2020, at par with other economies.\nThe electronics industry can increase employment in the country significantly, since some of its segments, such as \nelectronic system manufacturing, are human capital- intensive. The industry employs around 4.4 million people currently and this number is expected to grow to 16.1 million in 2014 and 27.8 million in 2020.\nThe electronics industry has a high potential for domestic value addition, especially in some of its segments, e.g., \nsemiconductor design and electronics system/product design.\nElectronics can facilitate e-governance, developmental schemes and initiatives launched by the government, \ne.g., Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA), Restructured-Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme \n(R-APDRP) and Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGREGA). The government’s allocation of funds for developmental schemes and initiatives is close to USD 45 billion. However, IT intervention is required to ensure the effective implementation of these schemes and initiatives.\nThe government is in the process of setting up Common Service Centers (CSC) at the village level, increasing tele-\ndensity, scaling up broadband access and power availability. These initiatives aim to modernize and transform India, enable equitable and inclusive growth and make ICT relevant for everyone in the country. We may have to go many steps in that direction to a connected country with access to all, by introducing schemes such as \nSchool-school mein computer yojna, Gaon-gaon mein computer yojna and Ghar-ghar mien computer yojna , which l\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\n48need to be implemented to achieve this. Although these schemes require heavy investment, they offer huge \nopportunities for the manufacturing and design industries to create designs for products manufactured in India.\nThe government’s long-term vision should focus on enhancing the role of technology in key verticals, as listed \nbelow, to augment initiatives in these areas.l\nREcoMMEnDa TionS\nThe Government of India would do well to foster a globally competitive industry . \nThe industry needs to focus on the following:\nIncreased value addition\nImplementation of best practices Catering to the needs of domestic and global markets by creating innovative product designs and R&DDriving cost competitiveness\nThe government can catalyze this growth by the following measures: l\nlllVision 2020\nInformation \naccess to allEnergy Healthcare Education Digitization Security\nindia needs to follow the example of countries such as France, where access to the \ninternet is a right rather than a service. The internet opens up vast avenues ranging from basic \ninformation, education and access to public services. connectivity \nshould therefore be integral to the indian government’s vision for 2020.\n1\nPromote existing \nclusters and create new onesEstablish ‘National Electronics Mission’\nRationalization of \ntax structure65 Creation of a \nmanufacturing value addition fund 4Creation of a R&D fund3“Made for India” Goods2\n7Promote skill development Government needs to focus on skill development, regulations around over-time and contracts need to be flexed.Establish ‘National Electronics Mission’ – a nodal agency for the electronics industry within DIT and with direct interface to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The nodal agency will help in the synchronized functioning of the industry. It will enhance the ease of doing business.\nStable tax structure needs to be put in place in order to encourage long term investment by the companies.A separate fund may also be created to provide interest linked subsidy to promote value added manufacturing and create products for India.A fund may be created to incentivize R&D, where the government and the industry bodies are stake holders.Encourage products specifically designed for India. Developmental sector can benefit from biometric readers, smart meters, micro payment devices, and low cost devices.Create islands of excellence by encouraging and planning for the expansion of \nexisting centers such as Sriprembudur, Noida, etc. and identify more locations to set up clusters to create a complete ecosystem where all the segments of the value chain are available at one location. Provide contiguous land and Infrastructure to the industry to these clusters.Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n49Certain procedural intervention measures will also be imperative:\nRecommendation 1: Monitoring and auditing mechanism for government funded initiatives.\nRecommendation 2: Make the recipients of government funds accountable for efficient and timely utilization of \nthe funds by making them time-bound.\nRecommendation 3: Initiate a multi slab investment program, linked to manufacturing value addition, through \na Special Purpose Vehicle for the electronics industry.\nThe various segments of the electronics industry need to be given an impetus. Each segment of the electronics ecosystem varies in the extent of value addition it requires, its contribution to the economy and its future growth potential. These factors have been elaborated on in the matrix below:l\nl\nl\nIt is essential to have in place the right policies and regulatory environment to drive sustainable growth across the \nsegments and create full-fledged electronic systems and a design and manufacturing ecosystem in India.\nWe have shared a more detailed perspective of industry-wide recommendations in this report and have also elaborated \non recommendations that are specific to each of the industry segments in the following chapters.Industry \nsegmentValue addition \nindexEmployability \nindexContribution to \nGDPSize of industry \n(USD billion)Growth \npotential\nSemiconductor designH LM ->H \n(Long term)9.0 Very high\nHigh-tech manufacturing M MM -> H \n(Long term) 0.6 Long-term impact\nElectronic componentsL M L 2.1 Very high\nEMS/Assembly L H L 1.0 Medium\nElectronic systems designH M H 27.9 Very high\nL: Low, M: Medium, H: High\nway FoR waRD\nThanks to the fast pace of technology evolution, industry again has an opportunity to leapfrog some of the earlier \ntechnologies and be globally competitive.\nThis will require a strong push to rapidly develop the electronics ecosystem and for the industry to develop a strategy. \nImpetus needs to be given to the small and medium enterprises (SME) as they drive the growth in this industry .\nAs China and Taiwan are way ahead in competition, India’s focus may be on value addition. Abundant talent pool and resources could be utilized to produce high-value products, hence domestic value addition may be encouraged and incentivized. Further, tomorrow’s markets are expected to emerge in the Middle East, Africa and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). India is uniquely positioned geographically to export to these markets as well as Europe vis-à-vis China. Establishing business relations in Africa is easier due the Africa’s openness towards India.‘Electronics industry’ entails electronic systems design and manufacturing which \ncomprises semiconductor design, high-tech manufacturing, electronic components, EMS, and electronic systems design for consumer electronic products, telecom products and \nequipments, and iT systems and hardware. The industry may be \ndesignated as a strategic industry having a nodal agency within DiT and with direct interface to the PMo.Executive summary\n\n50It will also be imperative to identify unique Indian needs and for both the manufacturing and design industry to create \na designed for India, manufactured in India product strategy which can also open doors for export to large markets in developing economies with needs and demographics akin to India.\nBoth the industry and government need to look at this opportunity with a sense of urgency, as it can transform the \nface of the nation (in the same way software has achieved in some IT hubs) and propel the nation and industry players to another high growth trajectory, generate employment and augment India’s branding as a technology powerhouse. India today can ill afford to miss this immense opportunity in this strategic industry and lose ground to other competitive countries.Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n51Size of the global electronics industry vis-à-vis other major industries\n4.40 times oil, petrol and minerals\n2.75 times chemical and plastics2.45 times food, beverages and tobacco2.44 times transportation2.20 times electricity, gas and water2. need for domestic manufacturing\nMaRkET PoTEnTial: ThE DEManD FoR ElEcTRonicS\nglobal electronics industry\nThe global electronics industry is estimated at USD 1.75 trillion for 2009.

Nearly 10 million households are es-\ntimated to have income levels above USD 10,000 per annum. With a annual growth rate of 20%, this segment offers significant opportunities for electronics products. Transformation of electronics goods from an aspiration to a utilitar-ian need has made these products more affordable for people. Further, the quick rate of obsolescence in technology is bringing down the prices of products and making them affordable for lower income groups as well. \nDriver 2: g\novernment focus on infrastructure\nThe Indian government is keeping to its promises and its objective to achieve inclusive growth for all sections of so-\nciety and realizes the critical role of education, rural employment and power sector reforms in the socio economic development of the country. These three sectors lay the foundation for the development of human capital and indus-trial growth. The government has launched a number of programs to augment growth in these sectors.\nThe government has also brought in major policy changes by passing the Right to Primary Education Bill to give a boost \nto the education sector. After the success of SSA in achieving substantial enrolment in schools, the government now aims to provide free access to secondary education in the country. Government initiatives such as MGREGA aim to increase livelihood and job opportunities. \nDriver 3: i\nncreasing spend on iT equipment\nIT and ITES industries continue to drive the demand for the IT equipment. With public and private sector firms in \nIndia adopting automation, the demand for IT equipment is increasing. Government of India has announced National e-governance Plan for effective administration with an estimated budget of more than USD 9 billion for automating processes in most of the government departments. There are 27 mission mode and several important projects being undertaken. These would generate enough opportunity for the electronic industry to grow.\nDriver 4: n\need for innovative products at low cost \nIndia is a price-sensitive market and with unique socio-economic needs, it has a substantial demand for cost-effective \nand robust products. Products that meet basic requirements at penetration price points can create a market. A water purifier at a price point of less than USD 41, a mobile phone at a price less than USD 23, a car at a price less than \nUSD 2,100, marketed by leading companies, have all met with a huge success.Need for domestic manufacturing\nTotal domestic production of electronics\n\n54Driver 5: intellectual property in india\nIndia should pave the way for encouraging conversion of its ‘intellect’ into actual ‘property’ by providing incentives to \nretain intellectual rights. This will not only mean more direct contribution to the country’s exchequer, but also create business opportunities and generate employment. Above all, such new opportunities can result in bridging the digital divide further. IP creation gives revenues that are at the least 10 times more than the ‘creation costs‘. Currently, India creates close to 90% of the value chain, yet, gets ‘credit’ for only about 10%. If the IP is ‘owned’ by India, then this entire revenue from the IP creation (i.e. 100%) is credited to India vs. the 10% in the current ‘service’ model.\nDEManD-SuPPly gaP \nThe rapid growth in the demand for electronics, clubbed with the slow rate of increase in domestic production, has resulted in an increasing demand-supply gap in the industry. While the demand for electronics stood at USD 45 billion in FY09, goods worth USD 20 billion were produced in India. \nDemand supply-gap projected to increase further \nby 2020\nTotal demand\nThe demand for electronics is expected to increase at 22% \nannually during the FY09–20 period to reach USD 400 billion. This includes domestic consumption and exports.\nDomestic production\nAt the current growth rate of 16%, electronics production is \nexpected to rise to USD 104 billion in FY20. This will result in a significant increase in the demand-supply gap, which will rise to USD 296 billion.\nHence, it is essential to achieve a higher pace of growth. \nThe targeted growth rate in the production of electronics is 31% annually for the FY09–20 period, to reach a value of USD 400 billion. While USD 80 billion worth of products are expected to be exported, it is projected that USD 320 will meet the domestic demand.Source: CEHA and FICCI\nSource: Industry estimates\nat the current pace, the demand-supply gap is projected to increase from \nuSD 25 billion in F\ny09 to uSD 298 billion in Fy20.\nRESul T: TRaDE iMBalancE\nThe trade imbalance is projected to increase to uSD 323 billion by 2020.\nDomestic production is unable to fulfill the demand in the market.

Further, the country’s electronic industry has witnessed phenomenal growth in terms of its manufacturing capabilities, employment opportunities and contribution to total exports. A variety of l\nlllNeed for domestic manufacturing\n\n56factors, such as the country’s political and economic stability, investor-friendly policies, productive workforce as well \nas its robust infrastructure, have been responsible for this growth.

The \ngovernment also offers other significant tax incentives such as a pioneer status, investment tax allowance, \nreinvestment allowance, incentives for high technology industries, as well as others for manufacturing projects under the Promotion of Investments Act 1986 and the Income Tax Act 1967.\nVietnam: Emerging manufacturing destination\nDuring the past 10 years, Vietnam has consistently witnessed high economic growth, which, coupled with political stability in the country, has been the key driver to attract foreign investors. \nFactors such as strong work ethics, improved infrastructure, reduced labor costs and the availability of a skilled \nlabor pool have also been instrumental in making Vietnam an attractive destination for Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS), semiconductors and Original Device Manufacturing (ODM). \nAnother key factor that has attracted foreign direct investment in Vietnam is the country’s “China plus one” \nmodel, wherein companies are opting for Vietnam to reduce their dependence on China and evenly spread their business risks in Asia. l\nl\nlElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n573. challenges faced by domestic manufacturers\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by a US MNC, infrastructure and taxation issues are the two main factors \ninhibiting foreign investments in the Indian electronics ecosystem. The major factors that require immediate attention are detailed below:\nThe prime challenges that need to be addressed to drive growth in the Indian electronics ecosystem include:\nchallenge 1: \ninadequate infrastructure interrupting growth\nThe three elements of infrastructure posing significant challenges to Indian manufacturers are:\nPower: Power drives the manufacturing industry. India has a rising demand and not sufficient supply. There are \nleakages at the distribution level which result in losses. \nTransportation: Lack of adequate infrastructure is affecting the attractiveness of India as a manufacturing \ndestination. The country’s infrastructure is in a poor condition vis-à-vis China. The gap between the two countries \nis widening every year with China investing 20% of its GDP in infrastructure as compared with India’s 6%.\nland: Acquiring \nland to set up manufacturing facilities is a time consuming process in India. Further, there have \nbeen instances of significant delays.\nThese infrastructural challenges make doing business in India difficult.\nchallenge 2: \nTax issues\nWhen compared to low cost destinations such as China and Taiwan, India’s current tax structure makes the final \nproduct less competitive. \nTax structure prevalent in the country encourages low cost imports which have retarded the growth of the local \nmanufacturing industry.\nStability of taxation is another issue. Companies cannot plan a long-term investment in the country as the tax \nstructure/policies keep changing.\nchallenge 3: \nlimited preferential market access for local companies \nAs of now there are no preferential laws or incentives in place which enforce usage of domestic products to some extent. This results in excessive import of low cost products leaving no means of revenue generation for the local companies.\nChallenge 4: Non-availability of finance at competitive cost\nSmall and medium industry is a growing segment and a key driver of growth for electronics manufacturing. This segment \nneeds proper financing at competitive cost which is currently not available, hindering growth of the industry . l\nl\nl\nl\nllChanges necessary to attract investment\n\n58challenge 5: Supply chain and logistical hindrances\nIn the current scenario, India has a poor component manufacturing base. Components are imported from countries \nsuch as China, Taiwan and Korea. In India, poor logistics infrastructure complicates the supply chain. The inability of domestic manufacturers to accurately predict the receipt of raw materials mandates high inventory levels to ensure uninterrupted production. This adds to the cost of production and the declining competitiveness of domestic manufacturing units.\nchallenge 6: \nlimited R&D focus\nCompetitors such as China and Taiwan are way ahead of India in the volumes game. The focus area should be adding \nmore value to the existing products and creating new products through investment in R&D. Every company should be encouraged to invest in R&D through incentives for Intellectual P roperty Rights creation.\nChallenge 7: Inflexible labor laws\nUnder the current labor laws, the ability of an organization to align employee strengths with demand cycles is \ncurtailed. Flexibility in labor laws is essential to cater to rapid seasonal variation in demand. Regulations around over-\ntime and contracts also makes it difficult to meet the highs and lows of demand.\niMPacT on ManuF acTuRing oF ElEcTRonicS in inDia\nimpact on costs and returns\nManufacturing of electronics in India faces significant challenges. High transaction costs are the result of stringent \nrules and regulations, complex administrative processes and infrastructural deficiencies. \nAn analysis by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) reveals that cost disabilities, including the \ntransaction costs borne by Indian exporters, vary and range from 19–22%. In contrast, exporters in developed economies pay only 2–3% of transactional costs.\nThe following table illustrates the net impact of these issues on a electronics manufacturer in India vis-à-vis one in \nChina for a 50% value-added product with an assumed sales price of INR100:\nIndia China Remarks\nSales (-CST @ 2%) 100 - 2 = 98 100The 2% Central Sales Tax (CST) translates \nto a selling price of INR98.\nRaw materials (+ CST@2% on 50% local supplies)48 + 0.48 48Assuming 50% value addition, there is an additional CST on local supplies.\nRaw material support and logistics2.5 1\nThis is due to the impact of logistics, power and financing costs.

Recommendations to drive growth in indian \nelectronic systems, design and manufacturing ecosystem\ngoVERnMEnT MuST PRoViDE iMPETuS FoR DoMESTic ManuF acTuRing\nIn order to drive high growth in the industry, it is imperative for the government to provide impetus to the domestic \nmanufacturing industry. Following recommendations are aimed at the government to help create the necessary push:\nRecommendation 1: Establish a ‘national Electronics Mission’\nEstablish a nodal agency for the electronics industry within DIT and with direct interface to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The nodal agency may have the following functions:\nBuild and promote “Brand India”\nAttract investments to IndiaFacilitate doing business in IndiaR&D fund managementManufacturing value addition fund management\nThe National Electronics Missions may be structured on \nlines of the National Solar Mission.\nIn order to attract investments, the nodal agency shall \ntake India’s value proposition – a world class infrastructure and rising domestic demand – to the world.\nThe nodal agency shall carry out the functions as that of \nthe Foreign Investment Implementation Authority (FIIA) specific to electronics sectors.\nThis single nodal agency shall also facilitate vertical coordination between the centre and the states as-well-as \nhorizontal coordination amongst the various concerned ministries.\ncase study: national Solar Mission\nobjective: to make India a global leader in solar \nenergy and envisages an installed solar generation capacity of 20,000 MW by 2020, of 1,00,000 MW by 2030 and of 2,00,000 MW by 2050 \nimplementation: \nFinancial division \nn Create and manage funds\nn Oversee capital subsidy funding through \nbanks\nTechnology & tariff division\nn Monitor global and domestic technology development\nn Define tariff levelsl\nllll\nl\nl\n\n62Special projects\nn Execute utility and rooftop demonstrating projects\nn Set up solar generation plant infrastructure\nResearch and Development\nn Set-up a research council\nn Set-up a centre of excellence for solar energy\nn Involve academic institutions\nHuman Resource and development\nn Involve academic institutions\nn Introduce a government Fellowship programme\nRecommendation 2: Promote existing clusters and create new ones\nIndia has created a world class manufacturing ecosystem in Sriperumbudur, which is a testimony of India’s capability as \na low cost manufacturing country. It is essential to take this success forward and set up world class infrastructure.\nFurther, the government may identify more locations to set up clusters and replicate the success of Sriperumbudur. \nThis will bring in synergies, save costs and improve competitiveness. States should be encouraged to create electronics manufacturing clusters provided they satisfy certain basic minimum ‘hygiene factors’ to enable creation of end-to-\nend value chain with up-stream and down-stream industries in close proximity . These are:l\nl\nl\nState Nodal Agency for single window clearance and \ninter-departmental co-ordination.\nReady infrastructure, easy access to port/air-port and \nState-of-the-art logistics for fast track clearance and quick turn-around.\nMaking available land, power and other amenities \nwithin state control at concessional rates\nEasy access to Financial Institutions and Commercial \nbankl\nl\nl\nlCreate access to talent - Infrastructure for skilled \nmanpower, Technical/Vocational training institutions\nInfrastructure for collaborative R&D and TestingInstitutional framework \nfor market development – \nNational and InternationalSoft-Infrastructure and \namenities for employees – quality \nhousing, health-care, education facilities, restaurants, \nentertainment avenues etc.l\nl\nl\nl\ncase study: Sriperumbudur, Tamil nadu\nIn 1996, Hyundai Motor India became the first MNC to set up a manufacturing facility at Sriperumbudur in Tamil \nNadu. The MNC was followed by 50 ancillary manufacturing units, which turned the area into an auto manufacturing hub. The South Korean auto major has invested USD 888 million in India. \nIn 2001, Saint-Gobain, the France-based glass manufacturer, followed with a USD 118 million facility, also at \nSriperumbudur, and subsequently invested another USD 177 million in the project.\nIn 2005, Nokia set up a cell phone-manufacturing facility in its SEZ at Sriperumbudur. After this, a host of smaller \ncompanies followed suit, setting up their own manufacturing facilities in the area. \nThe key factor that enabled the tremendous growth in this region is its enabling bureaucracy, which expedites \nthe processes of land acquisition and other procedures. Further, the state’s single-window clearance scheme facilitates setting up of manufacturing facilities at Sriperumbudur. The availability of skilled manpower adds to the attractiveness of this cluster.\nRecommendation 3: Provide preferential market access to local companies\nEncourage the production of “Made in India” goods by reserving a particular share in the market for Indian products. MNCs are also setting up design centers that specifically cater to the Indian market. Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n63This can be achieved in the following manner:\nRecommended 30% of the demand must be met by products made in India if they are technically and commercially \ncompetitive for government procurements.\nUsing products made in India to execute national projects such as national knowledge network, rural broadband \nand Common Service Centers (CSC). \nSpecifying 30% value addition for foreign investment in a specific technology if products made in India do not \nexist in a specific technology area.\nUsing products made in India as part of bi-lateral trade and providing trade-in grants in the form of the \nproducts.\nRecommendation 4: create R&D fund for the industry\nAn R&D fund may created where the government and the industry bodies are stake holders. This may be used to incentivize research and innovation leading to growth of the industry .\nRecommendation 5: create manufacturing value addition fund for the industry\nTo enable the industry access funds at internationally competitive rates, a manufacturing value addition fund (in the form of interest subsidy fund) may be created to promote domestic value addition. The fund may be used to provide financial assistance in the following manner:\nProvision of interest subsidy linked to value addition.\nProvision of interest subsidy linked to increasing the local content of Bill of Material (BOM).\nRecommendation 6: Rationalize tax structure\nStable tax structure needs to be put in place in order to encourage long term Investment by companies.\nFavourable taxation rates extended under the recent fiscal incentive package should be continued and prevail \nlong-term to make available products at affordable prices.\nThe introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is expected to bring rationality and transparency to the tax \nstructure. However, challenges of Octroi, Surcharge and Entry tax need to be eliminated.\nRecommendation 7: Promote skill development\nIt is estimated that around 16.1 million people will be directly employed in the industry by 2014 and 27.8 million \nby 2020, as compared to the current 4.4 million. According to the report on Manpower for electronics industry, the concentration of manpower is in the manufacturing segment followed by after sales and sales support. R&D on the other hand employs the least number of people. Regulations relating to over-time and contracts also need to be revamped to meet the highs and lows of demand. Hence, the government needs to focus proactively on skill development. The recent report on ‘Human Resource and Skill Requirements in Electronics and IT Hardware’ by the National Skill Development Mission may be referred to in this regards.\nRecommendation 8: Sustainable growth and development – green electronics & e-waste \nManagement\nTo ensure sustainable growth and development of the electronics industry in India, standards for the energy efficiency \nfor electronics products in harmonization with international standards need to be developed urgently for the Indian market. Suitable incentives will need to be offered to encourage companies to adopt such standards. Further, the issue of e-waste management needs immediate attention. The government should announce a dedicated legislation for the management of e-waste, mandating all stakeholders in the electronics value chain to execute their responsibilities and liabilities with no adverse impact on the environment. Producers/manufacturers, through effective take-back l\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlRecommendations to drive growth in Indian electronic systems, design and manufacturing ecosystem\n\n64programs, need to ensure that e-waste is recycled in an environmentally sound manner. Similarly, component \nmanufacturers should ensure that the content of hazardous elements is minimized (R oHS).\nRecommendation 9: Demand consolidation to boost manufacturing\nIT based security systems are gaining importance for protection of buildings/campuses as well as surveillance \nand response capabilities. By designing an effective bulk procurement system for consolidated requirements, the consequent manufacturing capabilities in IT hardware and sensors would have beneficial effects in related IT , telecom and electronics fields.\nIT equipments like computers for school are required in very large numbers for schools. Similarly, with \nimplementation of e-governance projects underway, there is a significant requirement of IT products by the States. Suitable bulk procurement could be designed, incorporating the conditions for domestic manufacturing, to meet such demand.\nThere is a strong case to move away from incandescent technology for lighting to LED-based technology directly, \nbypassing CFL route, since disposal of CFLs has a significant adverse impact on the environment. Creating bulk procurement program as in case of the CFL lamps, manufacturing of the LED lighting would get a boost. Further, through a similar mode, the solar PV lanterns with LED bulbs for remote village lighting under the RGGY or MNRE Scheme can also boost value addition and manufacturing of LED in India. In the long-run, efforts need to be made to make silicon chip for the PV lanterns domestically by encouraging the domestic manufacturers so that the supply chain can be complete.\nAll defense and homeland security procurement of IT/electronics equipment should be progressively opened up \nto the private sector which shall be encouraged for Value-addition/increasing local content as specified by the \nsaid agencies. This would provide fillip to local manufacturing.\nProcedural intervention measures\nApart from the recommendations given earlier in this report, certain process improvements that may drive growth in domestic manufacturing include:\nRecommendation 1: Formulating and implementing a monitoring and auditing mechanism for government-funded \ninitiatives:\nImplementation of e-governance projects should be tracked and their progress made public.\nRecommendation 2: Making the recipients of government funds accountable for their efficient and timely utilization \nby making such funds time-bound; enforcing penalties for non-achievement of pre-determined objectives, e.g., conversion of grants to loans, as in the case of APDRP .\ncase Study: R-aPDRP – what was different?\nThe key takeaway from R-APDRP is its execution strategy. \nThe scheme has clear timeframes for execution and delivery. Funds are allocated in advance to the stakeholders of the policy. There are two parts to the scheme, and only \nif utility completes the first part, can it invest in the second. \nMoreover, in this policy, funding is directly related to the outcome within a definite period of time. If stipulated \ntimelines are met, the government converts the loan into a grant. If the utility does not complete the project in the specified time, it has to pay back the loan. \nFurther, the program tries to minimize the work required to be done on the field, e.g., preparing a shortlist \nof consultants, system integrators and project executors and chalks out a plan of action, which includes the list of products or applications that need to be used. l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nlElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\nContd..\n\n65 This scheme recognizes the importance of IT as a tool and lays emphasis on the use of technology as well as \non funding. \n Most importantly\n, R-APDRP is the only scheme that gives incentives to people in the utility if they are able to \nmeet loss-reduction targets.\nRecommendation 3: A multi-slab, multi-threshold incentive package such as the Special Incentive Package Scheme \n(SIPS) should be announced to attract electronics manufacturing Investments at various levels. This is to offset the \ndisability costs suffered by the domestic manufacturers on account of infrastructure and other handicaps. Such a package can be administered through a through a Special Purpose Vehicle where the disbursement mechanism could be linked to the proportion of domestic value addition in each of the industry segments/verticals. The Special Purpose Vehicle could be created under the proposed ‘National Electronics Mission’ or the Department of IT .\nDRiVE cuST oMiZa Tion wiTh ‘MaDE FoR inDia’ PRoDucTSl\nl\n“Made for india” products\nGovernment can encourage the use of products made in India for developmental initiatives such as e-governance \nplan, UID, SSA and R-APDRP .\nCreate standards for voltage, frequency and thermal variations as well as EMC/EMI and safety, which will reduce \nthe imports of sub-standard products into the country. \nEncourage development and deployment of bilingual (english with one or more Indian languages) software in \norder to address the language barrier in local markets. All computing devices procured by the Government should be enabled with local language interface.\nCreate and make available product specification for government initiatives in advance. This will provide the Indian \nmanufacturers with the lead time to create products, align production and make the necessary investments. E.g. Digitisation of broadcasting infrastructure, UID, financial inclusion and others.\nWith the growing trend of convergence, it is essential to promote a ‘internet with a device’. This initiative should \nideally be funded through the USO fund.\nGovernment procurement with higher local value addition should be encouraged.\nREcoMMEnDa TionS To EncouRagE PRE-coMPETiTiVE RESEaRch\nRecommendation 1: Offer R&D grants to companies that generate product revenues from the country and have \nsubstantial local value addition done from within the country.\nRecommendation 2: To encourage innovation in the industry, permit 300% expenditure on R&D/New Product \nDevelopment/Indigenization for deduction from taxable income.

Currently, \nthe country is not fully utilizing its talent and capabilities in manufacturing to address this increase in demand. As \nsuch, the government can set up manufacturing plants, generate employment, lower the existing level of imports and give impetus to the economy. Exports in the industry are expected to increase to USD 80 billion by FY20. \nSignificant growth potential: Growth in the industry will boost the economy, as this industry works as a feeder \nindustry for other industries. Enhanced production in this industry will lead to growth in several other industries \nwhere hardware/components are required.\nEmployment opportunities: It is anticipated that the industry can potentially employ close to 27.8 million by \n2020. Employment features as one of the most important priorities on the government’s agenda. This industry is \nlabor-intensive and can employ a large number of people with standard educational qualifications. \nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs): The SME segment is the key growth driver of the manufacturing industry. \nHowever, the sector is cost-sensitive, and if low-cost imports from other countries are not minimized, it is likely to face challenges.\nnation’\ns strategic and security interests: Electronics used in aerospace, defense and other parts of strategic \nestablishments are mostly imported. This can pose threats of design leakage or any other intrusion, which may \nhamper the country’s security.

Creation \nof local IP should be encouraged.\nRecommendation 2: National projects (national knowledge network, rural broadband and so forth) should be \nexecuted using Indian products.\nRecommendation 3: The government should encourage incubating Indian start-ups. The government may set \nup a focused venture fund of around USD 50 million to provide seed and start-up capital for new ventures to \nundertake R&D and product development.\nRecommendation 4: The government can subsidize acquisition of EDA tools by start-ups and other SMEs in this \nsector. Prototype development centres with adequate fabrication facilities can be set up. Include the entire revenue earned by fabless companies for benefits under STP and SEZ policies, as long as 90% of the design is done in India.\nRecommendation 5: Provide special tax incentive to entrepreneurs from within and outside India setting up \ndesign and development centres in India.\nRecommendation 6: Extension of EHTP/STP scheme till the year 2015.\nRecommendation 7: Creation of a fund to provide fiscal support to SMEs and MSMEs on a continual basis.\nhigh-TEch ManuF acTuRing \nDemystifying semiconductor-related high-tech manufacturing \nThe semiconductor industry is pervasive in nature and is a key driver of the nation’s economy. Semiconductors \nrepresent the convergence of many devices, systems and technologies and are widely recognized as technology enablers for the entire electronics value chain. The pervasiveness of semiconductors in other fields has become pivotal in giving the industry a competitive edge. \nSemiconductor manufacturing extends beyond wafer fabs to include ATMPs (Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging \nfacilities (ATMPs), solar photovoltaics, displays, optical LEDs, displays, display panels, storage devices and advanced micro and nanotechnology products. These products and other semiconductor devices are used in several applications, such as telecommunications for ubiquitous accessibility, in electronics and consumer applications for product quality (e.g. PCs, mobile phones and TV sets), and in the automotive industry for safety, energy saving and driver assistance. As such, it is important that the domestic manufacture of these products be incentivized to give impetus to the Indian electronics system design and manufacturing industry.l\nll\nl\nl\nl\nlElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\nVision\nhigh-tech manufacturing relates to semiconductor-related manufacturing. This segment includes \nwafer fabs, aTMPs, solar PV manufacturing, storage devices, displays, display panels, lEDs and \nnano-technology products.\nProjected size of the segment: u\nSD 4 billion in 2014; 22.6 billion in 2020\nThe present and the future\nIndia has a large and growing market for electronic products, as the use of semiconductors in such products is \non the rise. \nThe following table illustrates the Total Market (TM) and Total Available Market (TAM) revenue trends for the \nsegment: \n l\nl\n\n\u0018\u0018SegmentTM revenues \n(USD billion)\nIT/OA 2.5\nWireless handsets 1.7\nCommunications 0.8\nConsumer 0.4\nIndustrial 0.1\nAutomotive 0.1\nOthers 0.3\nSource: Aneesha Dhar, “Transfer pricing report,” EY CBK, \nJune 2009, via IRADSource: “India Semiconductor Market – 2008,” ISA – Frost & Sullivan, January 2008 Indian semiconductor industry revenue trend \nSemiconductor fabs are capital-intensive and have a long gestation period. ATMPs, on the other hand, require \nmuch lower capex. Solar PV manufacturing offers yet another exciting opportunity – the use of solar panels, both for off-grid applications, especially, in the short to medium term, and for grid-connected power in the long term, augurs well for the growth of the domestic solar PV industry. Moreover, in line with energy conservation measures, LED manufacturing is also likely to be a high-potential area. In addition, the domestic manufacture of storage devices, displays, display panels and nanotechnology products should be encouraged.\nProduction in the segment is projected to increase to USD 4 billion in 2014 and 22.6 billion in 2020.\nPolicy and regulatory environment\nThe Indian government’s announcement of a semiconductor policy is a laudable initiative. It can be considered a \nmajor step toward attracting foreign companies to set up manufacturing facilities in India.\nThe policy covers wafer fabs and ecosystem units such as LCDs, storage devices, plasmas, photovoltaics, solar \ncells and nanotechnology products, and also includes the assembly and testing of such products.\nThe government will bear 20% of the capex for units located inside special economic zones (SEZs) and 25% for \nunits located outside SEZs.\nThe government has proposed a minimum investment of USD 555 million for semiconductor manufacturing (wafer \nfabs) plants and USD 222 million for ecosystem units. State governments may provide additional incentives to the investors. However, these incentives have not been extended to older plants with second-hand equipment. \nThe policy has attracted considerable interest from solar PV investors. However, in order to attract investments in \nwafer fabs and other ecosystem units, the following policy amendments have been proposed:\namendments to the semiconductor policy\nExtension of the policy\n Due to the uncertainty in the economic environment, it is difficult to project the year of revival of the semiconductor \nindustry. The experts opine that the present situation for the semiconductor industry would last for at least two years. As such, it is proposed that the deadline of March 2010 be extended to March 2015. The extension will provide time, as the slowdown has severely impacted the semiconductor industry, thus leading to piling: \nn To market the policy and improve India’s prospects of attracting investments\nn To highlight the importance of the domestic market to potential investors\nappraisal process\nn It is also suggested that the government takes faster decisions and makes early announcements of approvals \nof proposals in order to send positive signals to the other investors. l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlKey industry segments\n\n72Suggestions for, and amendments to, the semiconductor policy\nlowering the threshold limit for aTMPs and other ecosystem units\n The threshold limit for certain categories of ecosystem units such as ATMPs, optical LEDs, storage devices, LCD, \nFPD, photovoltaics, fuel cells, micro- and nanotechnology products (as defined in the Special Incentive Package \nScheme, or SIPS, needs to be re-visited, as these units may not require large investments of USD 500 million. Lower threshold limits of USD 100 million for the incentives available under the policy are expected to generate interest for such categories of ecosystem units that have not been seen so far. This lowered threshold limit needs to be defined in consultation with industry professionals. The above areas required for wafer fab, form an critical part in the high-tech manufacturing value chain. Manufacturing infrastructure located in high-tech areas of the country can also serve as a pull factor to set up wafer fabs. It may be mentioned that countries such as Vietnam, China, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia are well on their way. In addition, the government should identify and incentivize anchor investors in areas such as ATMP , storage, LCD and LED.\nFinancial closure commitment\n The current \npolicy requires investors to demonstrate the legally binding commitment of equity holders and \ndebt financiers to provide or mobilize funding for achieving financial closure (at least 90% of the total project \ncost). Projects envisaging large-scale investments are implemented in phases. As the major markets for the products from fab and ecosystem units are presently targeted at exports, investors find it difficult to produce legal documentation for achieving financial closures of such magnitude from financial institutions at the time of \nsubmitting the proposal.\nRelease of incentives \n The current policy provides for the release of the incentive being linked to the achievement of the threshold \ninvestment. It is proposed that the payment of the incentive to investors may be advanced, although the threshold investment may not have been reached as yet. The suggested measure would provide investors with funds at an \nearly stage, which is crucial for the project’s timely implementation. \ncomponents of project cost\n The \npolicy is not clear with regard to the inclusion of costs on utilities, interest charges and so forth as part of \nthe project cost. It is important that the total project cost of running the plant, including the items mentioned \nabove, are considered for the award of the incentives.\nRecommendations to promote solar PV manufacturing\nRecommendation 1: Industry size and volume of production are key issues to address the economies of \nscale. Scale and integration should be encouraged through the provision of higher incentives, as they reduce \nmanufacturing costs.\nRecommendation 2: The lack of adequate financial resources, particularly at attractive interest rates, is a \nkey barrier for the industry. The availability of funds at a less expensive rate will go a long way in attracting a large number of players in this area. The government can float tax-saving renewable energy bonds such as infrastructure bonds to collect low-cost funds from the general public.\nRecommendation 3: It is well-recognized that R&D and innovation are one of the key drivers of development in \nthe solar PV industry. Accordingly, the following initiatives are recommended to encourage R&D in this industry \nin India:\nn Collaborative research among government, R&D institutions and industry .\nn Coordination among various government departments doing R&D in this field.\nn Coordination among stakeholders, namely industries, research institutions under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and government departments such as Department of Science and Technology (DST)l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n73competitive landscape: china and Taiwan\nChina’s semiconductor market primarily consists of electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies, original \ndesign manufacturers (ODMs), and OEMs that consume chips in China.\nThe Chinese semiconductor industry’s revenue in 2008 totaled USD 76.5 billion. This is expected to decline 5.8% \nto USD 72 billion in 2009. \nChina is the largest IC market in the world, with a market scale at USD 85 billion in 2008. However , the market share \nof domestic suppliers was less than 7%.\nThe ease of doing business between semiconductor companies in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan continues \nto grow.l\nllln Commercialization of developed technology. \nn Development of a proper framework for technology transfer and collaboration within India as well as globally \nto obtain the best available technology as well as provide direction to future R&D.\nn Development of high-end skills for R&D to overcome the scarcity of scientists a nd researchers in this area.\nRecommendation 4: Equity funds/Venture funds should be created to nurture solar PV start-ups and seed funds \nfor solar PV research projects. \nRecommendation 5: A comprehensive national policy for solar energy in India based on the recommendations \nmade should be formulated to achieve set objectives and goals at the national level and encourage the growth of this sunrise industry. It is recommended that the growth of the solar PV industry should be implemented under \nMission mode. \nThe semiconductor industry’s growth enablers\nIT/Office automation (ITOA), wireless handsets and communication are the top three contributors to the semiconductor \ntotal market and the mainstays of TAM revenue generation. The rollout of third-generation (3G) and WiMAX services \ncan serve as the harbinger of associated infrastructure equipment. Other growth drivers include:\ngrowing \ndemand from the domestic market: The Indian market is witnessing strong demand. Increased consumer \nspending on entertainment and the rise in demand for related lifestyle products due to changing consumer \npreferences are key growth drivers.\ngrowing i\nT industry: Growth in the IT industry is also driving the semiconductor industry. The IT segment is \ndivided into IT systems and hardware and ITOA, which includes printers, notebooks, desktops, monitors, servers \nand copiers. IT/ITOA contributes 42% to TM and 46% to TAM in the semiconductor industry.\nEnabling policy environment: The government is making efforts to facilitate effective policy implementation. \nThe semiconductor policy of 2007 received an encouraging response – 17 proposals received envisaging investment \nof USD 35 million.\ngrowing \nhigh-tech design industry: The high-tech design industry is a high-growth segment and is expected to \nreach approximately USD 20 billion and USD 58.2 billion by 2010 and 2020, respectively .l\nl\nl\nll\nl\nSet-top boxes (STBs), wireless handsets, 3g rollouts, wiMaX, notebooks and smart \ncards are expected to primarily drive the indian semiconductor market.Key industry segments\n\n74china: future stateElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\nSource: “IDC: 2009 toughest year for China’s PC market,” ChinaDaily.com \nwebsite, http://chinadaily.com, accessed 2 October 2009.

As a result, demand for electronic components declined significantly over the years.\nThe International Trade Agreement (ITA) signed at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997 eliminated all customs \nduties on IT products, thereby creating an environment of direct competition between Indian component manufacturers and international players. Intensified competition weakened the cost competitiveness of Indian manufacturers, forcing many companies to exit the market.\nOver the years, the contribution of domestic manufacturing to domestic consumption has been declining. The following \ntable reveals that domestic component manufacturing has not been able to keep pace with the growth in demand. \n\n76Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\ncurrent State\nIn FY09, the Indian electronic component market \nwas valued at USD 2.1 billion, with an 11% share of the total electronics market. The electronic components segment supplies to the consumer electronics, telecom, defense and IT verticals. The various constituents of the electronic component segment are illustrated below:\nPassive components account for the largest revenue share of 23%. The key constituents include transformers, chokes and coils, capacitors and resistors. \nElectronic tubes have the second-largest \nrevenue share of 21%. The key constituents include TV picture tubes, X-ray tubes and cathode ray tubes.\nSegment size: current and projected\nThe production of electronic components declined \nby 13.3%, from USD 2.4 billion in FY08 to USD 2.1 billion in FY09.\nFor the five-year period of FY04–09, the segment \ngrew at a CAGR of 4.6%.\nFluctuations in growth rates and a decline in \nproduction characterized this period.\nThe production of electronic components is \nexpected to reach USD 2.6 billion in FY14 and \nUSD 3.4 billion in FY20.l\nl\nl\nl\nllSource: ELCINAIndian electronic components’ revenues: CY07\nSource: ELCINA, MAIT, EY analysisElectronic components production (USD billion)\nThe segment has significant potential for employment generation, with 70,000 \njobs expected by Fy14 and 200,000 jobs by Fy20. \ngrowth engines of the indian electronic components segment\nStrong demand: Strong consumer demand for products such as TVs, white goods, air conditioners and automobiles \nis driving the demand for electronic components.\navailability of \nskilled manpower: India has an abundance of skilled manpower. Each year, around three million \nscience and engineering graduates are added to the workforce, much higher than in China and other developed \ncountries. The quality of Indian graduates is also ranked better than in China, Vietnam as well as Japan and the US on certain parameters.\nRise in EMS: Currently, a number of OEMs are outsourcing their low-end product development, manufacturing \nand distribution to EMS companies to focus on the development of high-end products with higher margins, brand-\nbuilding and marketing and sales strategies. As such, EMS companies have significant market potential. The EMS segment in India has the ability to capture 2.2% of the global EMS market, which is projected to reach USD 497 billion by 2010.

Significant \ne-goverance initiatives and developmental plans, such as the UID project and MGREGA scheme, are also increasing \nthe demand for electronic components and devices. \nchanging dynamics of the segment\ngrowing consumer class: India has a growing consumer class, which comprises people with an annual income of \nmore than USD 10,000. The group is estimated to grow to more than 80% of the total population by FY10. This concurrently reflects on the available aggregate disposable income in the economy that may be channelized to increase sales of consumer products. \nlifestyle \nchanges: With greater exposure to global trends, Indians now have an increased affinity for convenience \nand lifestyle products. This is encouraging the launch of higher-end consumer products in the market. \nchallenges hampering growth of electronic components manufacturing\nchallenge 1: a zero import duty regime is impacting competitiveness\nThe zero-import duty structure encourages the import of finished electronic goods, leading to a decline in \ndemand for electronic components.\nchallenge 2: Rapid technological innovation mandates high capital investment\nT\nechnology changes rapidly in manufacturing sectors. In order to compete with low-cost destinations such as \nChina and Taiwan, India needs to keep pace with the technological innovations. As a result, the capital required to set up and maintain a manufacturing facility has increased manifold. It is even more difficult for an SME in this segment, since capital investment is high but the return on investments is almost insignificant, at around 7–9%.\nchallenge 3: \ninverted duty and taxation structure implies more tax\nWhen compared with China and Taiwan, India’s current duty and taxation structure makes the final product more expensive, as there is no duty on the import of electronic components. The inverted structure has resulted in higher tax rates for products with higher value addition.\nThe table below denotes value addition at different stages of the electronics manufacturing value chain, quantifying the impact of disabilities on components:l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nTherefore, value addition in the electronic components segment is second only to raw material, which results in a \nhigh-cost disability.\n\n\u0018\u0018Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\nchallenge 4: unavailability of raw material domestically\nMost of the raw material required for electronic component manufacturing is not available domestically. Hence, \nmanufacturers need to import material from countries such as China, Taiwan and Korea. The low production volumes of Indian manufacturers inhibits them to negotiate competitive rates from these suppliers, which impacts the cost of production.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 1: create hubs of excellence for component manufacturing: clusters\nCreate pockets of excellence or clusters to promote the manufacture of electronic components in India. These clusters will create scale, provide R&D and testing facilities, develop skill as well as address infrastructure challenges. \nNoida and Chennai may be the pilot zones for setting up such clusters. This is because each has the following:\nn Large concentration of electronic component manufacturers\nn Presence of the buyer segments: assemblers and consumer electronics manufacturers\nRecommendation 2: Encourage collaboration with international players\nRapid innovations in manufacturing technologies require significant capital investments. The collaboration of \nIndian manufacturers with international players is essential to provide access to technical knowledge and capital. Such collaboration will ensure higher standards of quality in manufacturing, leading to greater acceptability in the global market.\nRecommendation 3: Reduce the impact of transactional costs\nThe impact on the cost-competitiveness of manufacturers due to significant transactional costs and the duty structure may be rationalized. \nRecommendation 4: Focus on R&D and value-added products\nFocus on R&D and develop of value-added products to distinguish India from other countries. There is a need to \nidentify specific products where India’s cost competitiveness exists and encourage domestic manufacturing. l\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\n79Key industry segments\niT SySTEMS anD haRDwaRE\nThe global IT systems and hardware spending is estimated to have grown at 4% from USD 570 billion in 2007 to USD 594 \nbillion in 2008. North America and Asia each accounted for 28% of the market, while Western Europe accounted for 25% of the market in 2008. The IT systems and hardware industry in India is still looking to carve a niche in the global industry. This industry has immense potential for a multiplier effect on the economy; however, due to the lack of favorable government policies, the opportunity has largely eluded India. The government needs to create a conducive environment to foster demand in this segment, which in turn, can be leveraged for manufacturing investments. The recent demand-led-manufacturing success of the mobile handset industry in India is a good example. India has experienced phenomenal growth in PC sales. The number of PCs sold in India has increased to 6.7 million units in FY09 from 3.1 million units in FY04, translating into a CAGR of 17%.\nSegment size\ncurrent and projected state\nIndia, at 17% CAGR in FY09, is one of the fastest-growing \nIT systems and hardware market in the Asia-Pacific region. Nearly all the prominent global vendors and some local, have a strong presence in the Indian market. Most MNCs have their assembly units in India. With PC sales of 6.8 million units in FY09, the PC penetration stood at 2.6%. Notebooks and Netbooks have caught the fancy of the \nconsumers while growth of desktops has stagnated. \nIT systems and hardware: employment statistics\nR&D 3%\nManufacturing 21%\nSales 25%\nAfter-sales support 41%\nAdministration 10%Growth of sub-segments (2006–2008) (%)\n2006 2007 2008\nServers 27.3 15.2 16.2\nWorkstations and \nsingle user systems20.1 26.1 34.2\nPeripherals 27.2 36.4 39.6\nOthers 20.1 37.3 25.1Source: MAIT FY09 Annual Report Source: Aneesha Dhar, “Transfer pricing report – IT systems and hardware,” \nEY CBK, June 2009, via IRADSub-segment wise\nBFSI, telecom, ITES, manufacturing verticals, SMEs, \ne-governance and households are the key drivers of \nthe IT systems and hardware market in India.

SMBs \nin India are expected to invest approximately USD 4 billion on IT systems and hardware in FY10. Notebook PC-\nspending rose at 43% among Indian SMBs in FY07.\nawareness and \naffordability of technology: The increasing purchasing power of the Indian population has \nsignificantly boosted PC penetration in the country. increasing \nnotebook sales: Notebook sales are expected to drive the growth of the PC market as domestic and \nglobal vendors seek to penetrate lower-income segments, smaller and medium businesses and newer regions.\nTaxation/Policy \nWhile IT systems and hardware enjoy low taxation currently, as compared to some of the other sectors, the taxation/\npolicy has not been conducive to the growth and development of this segment historically . \nThe current taxation policy on IT systems and hardware:\nIT systems and hardware, covered under the IT Agreement of the WTO, does not attract any customs duty. However, a uniform 8% excise duty/CVD is levied. The current fiscal incentive of 8% must be maintained for the growth of the segment. This uniform excise rate across the entire IT value chain has mitigated the earlier challenge of unutilized CENVAT in the manufacturing of PCs due to higher excise rate on input components.\nA uniform 4% VAT is levied on IT products across all states in India. However, certain states deviate from this \nuniform rate or introduce taxes at their discretion, which is highly detrimental to the business. \nThe introduction of GST is expected in April 2010. This will make the tax structure simple, rational and transparent \nand will resolve the longstanding segment issues of the refund of SAD and unfavorable abatement rates on import on certain specified IT goods. However, the challenges of local taxes such as Octroi and entry tax would continue \nto agonize the segment. The industry has been demanding that such taxes be abolished.\nDynamics of the iT systems and hardware segment\nShift from oEM to oDM: Brands are transitioning from being an OEM to an ODM. There is a shift from manufacturing \nto managing consumers and maintaining brands. It has resulted in some of the leading EMS companies to set up \ntheir operations in India.\nBr\nanded P cs outsell assembled ones: With key PC-manufacturing firms expanding their market in India, \nnarrowing the price gap and providing excellent after-sales support, consumers are opting for branded PCs over \nassembled ones. \nnotebook \nsales growth surpasses that of Pcs: Notebook sales have driven the PC market in India in 2007–08. \nWith sales exceeding a million units in the second half of the last fiscal, the total sales of notebooks in 2007–08 \nexceeded 1.8 million units, growing at 114%.\nMoving from real to virtual: Virtualization creates a virtual version of a server or a platform. There has been \na dramatic increase in the number of organizations adopting virtualization, which enhances utilization and \nsignificantly reduces costs.\nadoption \nof open standards computing: Open standards computing is a philosophy of building IT systems. In \nhardware, open computing involves the standardization of plug and card interfaces and allows for considerable \nflexibility in the modular integration of the functions. It also helps in vendor independence. These multiple advantages are the contributing factors for the increasing demand.\nRising popularity of ultra-portable notebooks: Small, ultra-portable and inexpensive sub-notebook computers \nare slated to be the next big thing in the consumer market. Nearly all vendors have launched ultra-portables priced at less than USD 500.\ngrowing \ndemand for green data centers: These are energy-efficient, high-performance data centers in which \npower and cooling are far less expensive and environment-friendly. These features make green data centers more \nviable and eco-friendly. l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\n\n\u0018\u0018competitive landscape: china and Taiwan\nThe total sales in China are projected to be only 40.61 \nmillion units in 2009. According to IDC, desktop sales are expected to record a decrease of 6% to 24.8 million units by 2012. In contrast, the laptop sales in China are projected to increase by 19% to 15.8 million units in 2009. \nRecommendations\nRecommendation 1: Attention must be focused on creating \nrobust demand for IT products in the country.\nSpecial mission-mode projects for IT inclusion of the common man by 2014: \n \nn PC/device and broadband for every school with 1 PC/device per 4 student. \nn PC/device and broadband for every village with 1 PC/device per 20 people.\nand by 2020:\nn PC/device and broadband for every home. \nMaking finance available for IT purchase: \nn “Priority sector status” should be accorded to IT purchase – hardware, software and broadband for SMBs and households by nationalized/PSU banks as also by NBFCs and micro finance companies. The government should develop programs for concessional loans for these sectors.\nn The Central Government as well as state governments should provide interest free loans to all their employees for the purchase of IT products. Currently, such loans are available only to officials beyond a \ncertain ranking.l\nl\nlKey industry segments\nchallenges\nchallenge 1: Taxation - Frequent changes in taxation have resulted in companies not being able to firm up \ntheir long-term business plans, let alone make sizeable investments. It is only in the last two years that there \nhave been no changes in the central levies. The issue is further complicated with state governments, at times, imposing new taxes or changing product classification at their own will.\nchallenge \n2: Limited of incentives for investment: With no natural advantage for manufacturing and with uniform \ntaxation across the value chain, sizable investments, especially at the components and sub-assembly level have \nevaded the segment. Further, due to various reasons, some of the current schemes have been unable to enthuse fresh investments in the segment.\nchallenge \n3: Inadequate infrastructure/logistics: The country’s lack of infrastructure, coupled with insufficient \ninternational quality logistics, poses a challenge to the growth of the segments.challenge \n4: Low broadband penetration: India has 6.8 million broadband connections and only 60 million \ninternet users. Further, the quality of broadband remains much below the desired levels. This has hampered the \ndevelopment of a vibrant content industry, which has led to the absence of a virtuous cycle. Thus, the market for PCs/devices, without a pull factor, continues to remain limited. \nchallenge \n5: Slowing growth in domestic consumption: PCs recorded a negative growth of about of 7% in 2008–09. \nThe sales of notebooks that had been growing over 100% for the last consecutive four years declined by 17%. \nWhile the sales of PCs have picked up in FY09–10, they are yet to reach the buoyancy of the earlier years.l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nit is estimated that iT systems and hardware segment would generate employment \nfor 4.1 million in 2014 and 7.5 million in 2020 from existing 1.9 million in 2009 \nSource: “IDC: 2009 toughest year for China’s PC market,” China daily, \nchinadaily.com, accessed 2 October 2009Hardware spend 2007-2012\n\n82Incentivizing the consumer:\nn 100% depreciation on capital investment in IT – hardware and applications by companies once in a block of \nthree years. \nn The income tax rebates to individuals for the acquisition of computers once in three years, subject to a limit of INR50,000 and up to INR1,000 per month deduction from taxable income for broadband access. \ne-governance:\nn All the existing e-governance projects must be completed by 2014. There is a need to prioritize various projects of the government and track them annually. The annual financial allocation of funds for such projects should be correlated to the targets achieved, and in cases of non-satisfactory performance, the grant should be converted into loans.

With 494 million telecom subscribers (wireless and fixed line) at the end of August 2009, India’s telecom subscriber base is second only to China. Telecom services are significant contributors to India’s GDP . There is a 1.2% addition to GDP for every 10% rise in tele-density.\nThis growth has also boosted the telecom electronics and equipment manufacturing segment. India has emerged as \none of the fastest-growing markets for global telecom electronics and equipment vendors such as Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Huawei, Motorola and Nokia.\nkey events in \nindian telecom services space\nInitiated in 1991, the liberalization process led to the complete deregulation of telecom services. \nIn 1992, the value-added services segment, including mobile services, was open to private participation.The New Telecom Policy, announced in 1994, permitted the entry of one private operator in each circle. In 1997, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) was established as an independent telecom regulatory body.In 2008, the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) announced guidelines for 3G and WiMax spectrum auctions.\nSegment size: current and projected\nIn FY09, the production of the telecom elec-\ntronics and equipment segment increased by 11.7% to reach USD 10.5 billion.\nn This growth was primarily driven by a rise in the demand for wireless services in India, which fueled demand for mobile handsets.\nn According to the DoT , mobile handset production increased from USD 2.5 billion in FY07 to USD 6.5 billion in FY08, registering a growth rate of 160%.\nThe segment’s production is expected to reach USD 29.5 billion in FY14 and USD 153.5 billion in FY20.l\nllll\nl\nl\nSource: TEPCTelecom electronics and equipment production \n(USD billion) \nThe potential to increase exports of telecom electronics and equipment is \nsignificant.\nTelecom equipment: share of exports\nSource: TEPCDespite the segment’s strong \ngrowth of 29.9% annually during FY04–09, only 21.2% of the total production was exported in FY09.\nChina’s contribution to glob-\nal handset manufacturing is 50% as compared to India’s contribution of 8%. l\nl\n\n84The demand for mobile handsets is expected to increase from 110 million units in FY08 to 350 million units in FY20.\nThis represents a growth rate of 218.18%, trans-\nlating to a CAGR of 10.1%.\nTo cater to this burgeoning demand, it is \nexpected that the production of handsets in India will increase from 120 million in FY08 to 505 million handsets in FY20. \nFurther, the average price per handset in is \nexpected to decline to USD 41.5 by FY20, indicating that lower-priced handsets will play a significant role in capturing demand.\ncase for a growing domestic telecom electronics and equipment manufacturing industry\nEmployment generation: Given the right impetus, growth in the segment holds the potential to triple the country’s \ncurrent employment base by FY14.\nSignificant export potential: According to the Telecom Equipment and Services Export Promotion Council (TEPC), \nthe segment holds an export potential of USD 10 billion by FY14, further strengthening the case for a robust domestic manufacturing industry.\nIncreased competitiveness in the global market: A technologically advanced manufacturing ecosystem in India \nprospectively offers an international platform to Indian manufacturers. Thus, Indian players can expect to \ncompete globally with established manufacturers in the long run and make their own mark in foreign markets.l\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlgrowth drivers of the segment\nincreasing subscriber base: Despite the urban sector reaching saturation point, the growth of the wireless \nsubscriber base is expected to continue increasing steadily. According to the TRAI, the wireless subscriber base is \nexpected to grow from 457 million in August 2009 to 697 million by 2012. This represents a profitable opportunity \nfor global telecom electronics and equipment manufacturers in India.\ngrowth \nin rural mobile telephony: The rural markets are expected to drive the next phase of growth for telecom \nservices as the urban markets reach saturation point. It is expected that by 2012, the rural subscriber base will \naccount for nearly half of all subscribers with access to telecom services. The strengthening of the rural telecom network will create significant opportunities for telecom electronics and equipment manufacturers.\nBroadband penetration and connectivity: Broadband subscribers are expected to increase from 6.98 million \nin August 2009 to 27.3 million by 2012. Rising broadband penetration is expected to further drive growth in the segment. Broadband is an enabler for a wide range of applications such as e-governance, telemedicine and education. Thus, increased broadband penetration and connectivity can significantly impact job creation, innovation and the growth of the telecom electronics and equipment manufacturing industry .\n3g\n/wiMax: The expected launch of 3G services in the near future, offers significant growth opportunities for \ntelecom electronics and equipment manufacturers. The launch will create substantial demand for 3G-enabled handsets.l\nl\nl\nlElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\nEntry-level mobile phones and an increasing rural subscriber base are expected \nto drive demand in future.\nSource: EY analysisMobile handset demand estimates (million)\n*Figures for 2007 and 2008 are actual\n\n85Key industry segments\nan enabling policy and regulatory environment\nIn an attempt to boost manufacturing in the segment, the Indian government has implemented a series of policy \ninitiatives:\nThe Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) was incorporated in August 1984 as an autonomous body to \ndevelop advanced telecommunication technology in the country. The main objective was to establish a center for excellence in the telecom technology domain.\nThe Indian government’s Ministry of Commerce set up the TEPC in 2008 to promote the export of telecom \nequipment and services.\nThe government has declared that no license was required for the import of all capital goods for manufacturing \ntelecom equipment. \nThe government has also exempted infrastructure telecom equipment from customs duty . \nNo industrial license is required to manufacture telecom equipment. Instead, a simple industrial entrepreneur \nmemorandum (IEM) needs to be filed with the Secretariat for Industrial Assistance (SIA). \nThe government has made a provision of 100% FDI in telecom equipment manufacturing.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 1: Maintain the current taxation structure.\nn The current taxation structure for mobile handsets must be maintained for the long term growth.\nRecommendation 2: Encourage the domestic manufacturing industry by creating a strong market pull. \nn Incentivizing the telecom operators to buy indigenously manufactured telecom electronics and equipment keeping in view the national security concerns.\nn While awarding large contracts, preference should be given to local players.\nRecommendation 3: Telecommunication exports should be a part of bilateral trade programs.\nn Similar to the approach adopted by the Chinese government, telecom exports from India may be included in bilateral trade agreements with emerging markets in regions such as South Asia, Africa, Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe. \nn Indian trade missions in these regions should proactively seek opportunities in the telecom electronics and equipment domain and facilitate business interactions. \nRecommendation 4: Provide financial support.\nn Create an initial fund for R&D and product development for the segment. The Universal Service Obligation (USO) fund may also be utilized for this purpose. Under this fund products can be designed and such designs be given to multiple local manufacturers to produce them for unique local requirements.\nn Set up an autonomous body, similar to the Telecom Finance Corporation, to assist Indian players in setting up \na manufacturing facility and provide guidance.\nRecommendation 5: Create a mandate for operators to buy Indian equipment.\nn All telecom operators must be required to have multiple sources and should be required to buy at least 30% of Indian equipment, especially in areas where Indian companies already have globally competitive products. \nRecommendation 6: Attract investments for accessories.\nn Create a detailed program to attract investments for accessories such as batteries and chargers for mobile handsets.l\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\n86Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\nconSuMER ElEcTRonicS \noverview\nConsumer electronic manufacturing was launched in India in the 1950s by the production of radio sets. It was followed \nby the production of black-and-white TV sets in the 1960s and color TV (CTV) sets in 1982. \nThe Indian government initiated liberalization policies for the segment in 1992, relaxing controls such as licenses \nand the use of brand names. In 1994, the Indian market was open to major consumer electronic manufacturing multinational companies (MNCs), such as Panasonic, Sony, LG and Samsung.\nIn 2001, non-tariff barriers on imports was removed, and in 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Thailand \nwas implemented, resulting in the reduction of import duties on CTVs, color picture tubes, refrigerators and air conditioners. This led to increased competition with international manufacturers. \nCurrently, MNCs dominate the Indian consumer electronics market, which have major market share in most categories. \nThe growing middle class offers significant market potential to these companies. The demand for premium and luxury products is rising in the urban markets due to changing consumer lifestyles. Low-end products also have a significant market, especially in rural areas.\nSegment size: current and projected\nConsumer electronics is the dominant segment of the electronics industry, with a revenue contribution of 27%.\nDuring FY09, production in this segment was \nUSD 5.6 billion.\nFor the five-year period, the segment grew at \na CAGR of 11.1%.\nBased on its CAGR, consumer electronics \nproduction is expected to reach USD 8.1 billion by FY14 and USD 17.8 billion by FY20.l\nl\nllconsumer electronics is the largest segment of the indian electronics industry, \naccounting for 27% of the total domestic production revenue.\nThe segment holds significant potential for employment generation, with 2 million \njobs expected by Fy14 and 25 million by Fy20. Consumer electronics production (USD billion)\ngrowth drivers for the consumer electronics segment\nDigitization: Rapid implementation of digitization in India through media such as TV and radio and the immediate \nrollout of the conditional access system (CAS) is likely to generate demand for new products in India.\nHigher disposable income and availability of financing: Disposable income in rising, and consumer financing has \nbecome easier. This increased spending on lifestyle products such as TVs, air conditioners and white goods.affordable \nproducts: Advanced technology and increasing competition are narrowing the price gap, thereby \nleading to affordable products in most categories.l\nll\n\n\u0018\u0018increased organized retail: Organized retail segment is increasing rapidly. Currently the segment is 5% of the \ntotal retail market but is expected to grow to 15% by 2015. \nEstablishment of retail chains: The establishment of retail chains such as Croma, E-Zone and Reliance Digital, \nwhich exclusively cater to consumer goods, thereby increasing the demand.\nShorter replacement cycle: Rising incomes and evolving lifestyles have reduced the replacement cycle from \n9–12 years to 4–7 years. The trend of purchasing a second TV within a single household has also increased.\nThe changing dynamics of the segment\nRising demand for cTVs: CTVs are the largest contributors to this segment. During FY09, the domestic CTV \nsegment has been estimated to cross 13.5 million units. High-end products, particularly LCD TVs, continue to \nregister a high annual growth rate in FY09. Estimated at 0.8 million units, the LCD market registered more than 130% growth in FY09. LCD TV manufacturing in the country has begun, and as demand increases, the production is expected to increase.\ngrowth \nof the DVD market: Currently, the Indian DVD market is estimated at 7 million units, which is growing at \n15% annually. The market size is projected to be 10 million units by 2010. This is driving the sales of DVD players \nand audio equipment, thus spurring strong growth in the home theater segment.\nintroduction \nof direct to home (DTh) service: With the introduction of direct to home services, the market for \nset top boxes (STB) is growing rapidly. Indigenous sources are manufacturing around 25–30% of STBs.Decline in demand for black-and-white televisions: The production of black-and-white TVs continues to decline. \nCertain medium-scale units have moved to tax-exempted regions, and these units are performing OEM work for \nother well-known brands.\ncase study: Technology transfer in exchange for access to the domestic market\nIn the late 1980s, the Chinese government adopted the strategy of access to technology transfer in exchange for \ndomestic market (TTEDM). By doing so, the government encouraged MNCs to transfer advanced technology to local manufacturing units in exchange for access to the Chinese market. This incentive, along with the low labor cost and favorable regulatory environment under the export promotion zones (EPZs) scheme, resulted in the relocation of manufacturing units of many consumer electronic companies from the US, the UK, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong to Singapore, South Korea and China.\nThe measures under TTEDM include: \n Provisions are made for the continuous transfer of advanced technology through joint venture (JV) \nagreements.\n The review \nand approval of certain electronics JVs by the Central Government are mandated to ensure \ncompliance with industrial policies.\n A foreign direct investment (FDI) limit of 50% has been placed on local manufacturing setups.\n Labor-intensive JVs are restricted unless 100% export of output is guaranteed.\n The export of 70% of the output is mandatory\n.\nchallenges hampering growth of manufacturing in the segment\nChallenge 1: Significant cost of rural expansion\nConsumer electronics companies are setting up manufacturing operations in rural areas as land and labor costs \nin these areas is lower as compared to urban regions. However, expanding operations into rural markets requires significant infrastructural investments. Expenditure on the transportation of inventory to rural areas is greater l\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nll\nlKey industry segments\n\n\u0018\u0018due to lack of logistical infrastructure. Even LG and Samsung, which are considered to have the largest distribution \nnetwork in India, have a direct presence only in 15,000 to 18,000 of the 40,000 retail outlets in the country .\nPower is essential for the use of consumer products. The limited availability of power in rural areas is hampering the penetration of consumer electronics.\nchallenge 2: \nlack of skilled manpower implies training costs\nIndia has abundant manpower. However, the consumer electronics segment requires manpower with specialized experience in electronics. Training is, therefore, an additional investment manufacturers need to make. \n Recommendations\nRecommendation 1: Digitize india\nThe need to digitize India is imminent. India should digitize by 2014, this will release the much needed spectrum \nfor 3G and Wimax Services. Further, TV, radio and the immediate rollout of CAS are likely to generate demand for new products in India.\nRecommendation 2: i\nncentivize the rural expansion of consumer electronics manufacturers\nConsumer electronics manufacturers should be offered incentives to set up manufacturing units and expand distribution networks in rural areas. This is expected to provide access to economical labor as well as increase demand for consumer electronics in India.\nRecommendation 3: Encourage technology transfer and relocation of manufacturing units\nEncourage MNCs to set up manufacturing facilities in India either through JVs with local players or relocate their facilities from overseas locations through tax breaks. This will provide India with access to advanced global technologies and create a platform for higher value-added manufacturing.l\nl\nl\nl\nlElectronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n89appendix\nElEcTRonicS inDuSTR y STaTiSTicS\nDemand and production statistics\nTarget (USD billion)\n2009 2014 2020\nGlobal industry size 1,750 2,000 2,400\nDomestic industry size\nDemand 45 125 400\nProduction for domestic consumption 16 85 320\nProduction for exports 4 15 80\nTotal production 20 100 400\nShare in global production 1.2% 5% 16.6%\nValue addition < 10% 15–20% 30–40%\nSource: EY Analysis\nTarget (USD billion)\n2014 2020\nSemiconductor design 20.0 58.2\nHigh-tech manufacturing 4.0 22.6\nElectronic components 2.6 3.4\nElectronic Manufacturing Services 1.4 2.3\nElectronic systems\nConsumer electronics 8.1 17.8\nTelecom products and equipment 29.5 153.5\nIT systems and hardware 16.7 54.4\nOthers (Industrial, Automotive and others) 2.7 7.8Production estimates for key segments\nPolicy anD REgula ToRy EnViRonMEnT\nForeign direct investment (FDi) policy\nThe government has established the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to promote foreign investments in \nthe country through international companies, non-resident Indians and other foreign investors.

A drive for an hour on the highway from Taipei to the world famous Hsinchu \nScience Park, spread over 632 hectares of land, a IT park that houses virtually the all the MNCs in the semiconductor and IT industry, from Acer, chipmaker United Microelectronics to AU Optronics and D Link.\nThe Chinese are replicating the Hsinchu Science Park model for their own IT parks. This park involved the clusters of \nmost of the semiconductor component manufactures, thus saving on time and cost for assembly. This park includes independent wafer foundries, IC design companies, fabricators, as well as packaging and testing companies for the semiconductor industry all at one place. This allows for competition as well as cooperation and integration that is unique. It is a one-stop shop for a company looking for IC products.\nThe availability of high-tech professionals is available in Taiwan. The Hsinchu-based, government-funded Industrial \nTechnology Research Institute has hordes of laboratories in which over 5,000 researchers work in close unison with local companies. \nAs a result of this success, more than 40 spin-off park companies have been set up, based on the research. Two \nuniversities – National Chiao Tung University and National Tsing Hua University – are sited in the park area providing \ncompanies with a regular stream of outstanding professionals.\ngovernment policies\nEven government policy is clearly aimed at assisting companies in the park. Companies here are offered bank loans at \ninterest rates that are 2% lower than for loans to companies located in other parts of the city. Companies at the park do not have to pay duties on imported machinery or raw material. In addition, the over 179-member Taiwan Venture Capital Association offers funding. The success of the park has generated a huge corporate demand, so much so that Hsinchu is setting up four new parks spread over 600 hectares across the country for Taiwan’s high tech industry. Taiwan’s IT systems and hardware companies are not quite the low-cost, low-tech outfits that the world commonly \nperceives them as. Electronic systems, design & manufacturing ecosystem\n\n95In a multi-pronged strategy, they are shifting manufacturing to the Chinese mainland and simultaneously drawing on \nTaiwan’s research and development and high-tech designing skills, supported by research institutes and universities, in addition to building global brands. Notably, capital-intensive work is more prominent in Taiwan, while labor-intensive work is relatively more visible in China. Even the raw material is obtained from China. As a result, over a million Taiwanese work in China, and the two countries have a cordial work relation.Case study: Taiwan\n\n96References\n“Reinventing The Electronics Manufacturing Industry in India,” CEHA FICCI report\nMAIT FY09 annual reportDirectory of Indian Electronics Industry 2009, ELCINA“2009 Production Forecasts For The Global Electronics And Information Technology Industries,” Japan Electronics \nand Information Technology Industries Association, December 2008\n“India – The Economic Bellwether,” Debasish P .

A decade ago, India was at a similar inflexion point in the information technology (IT) and IT enabled services (ITES) industry that has accounted for 45% of incremental job creation between 1995 and 2005. Much of this success stemmed from government interventions designed to foster growth. As geo–political factors result in India emerging as one of the top–5 markets for defence equipment by 2015, the Indian government could make strategic interventions to replicate success. \nDEFEncE\nGlobal defence equipment procurement is expected to reach approximately USD 250 billion in value in 2009 and will increase by around 30% by 2015 and India will be world’s 3rd largest market for equipment. The key forces shaping the global market are:\nA shift away from traditional manned platforms to autonomous platforms in developed markets \nAn increased focus on asymmetric warfare and expansion of role of IT in defence resulting from increased levels \nof cyber crime \nIncreasing thrust on local production riding to counter relying on imports. To benefit from these trends, \nIndian companies can further harness their core competencies by focusing on opportunities in design and manufacturing such as:\nn Areas with higher technology intensity such as the integrated software plus hardware play in emerging areas such as homeland security, cyber warfare et al. More so IT spend is likely to be 4% to 5% of total defence expenditure by 2015. \nn Technology areas that need to be built domestically as global technology transfer is unlikely \nn Areas where the private sector can collaborate and provide superior execution capabilities to Defence Public Sector Units (DPSUs) such as fabrication \nRealising this opportunity calls for implementing key recommendations from the Kelkar committee report. In particular, the complete implementation of the Raksha Udyog Ratna Scheme, and modifications to the offset clause for more effective technology transfer. \naERoSP acE \nAs demand for aircrafts surges India, China and Russia are expected to account for 15% of global demand over the next 15 years. Three factors are driving industry growth in emerging markets, namely rise of new original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in emerging markets due to major commercial aircraft programmes, more global sourcing from low – cost countries, and outsourcing of R&D to emerging markets. Further, the offset requirement in India could stimulate a geographic shift of investment, approximately US$ 16 billion by 2024 and could help build a niche for India in the aerospace sector. \n To leverage these market trends Indian players can target at least 3 opportunity areas:\nn Avionics, engineering design and software opportunities, due to its cost advantages and engineering \nprowess. \nn Parts and sub-systems manufacture that can supplied to Tier I/OEMs \nn Maintenance, repair and overhauling (MRO) business the demand for which is expected to triple from US$ 600 million in 2008 to US$ 1.6 trillion in 2018. l\nl\nl\nl\n\n102nuclEaR\nThe increased focus on environmentally sustainable growth including the global focus on reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions is providing a big impetus to nuclear power development. In India, nuclear power is expected to contribute up to 25% to 50% of power generated by 2050, a massive leap from the current 3%. \nThe main opportunity for Indian manufacturers is collaboration with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited \n(NPCIL) in manufacturing reactor components. Another opportunity for Indian manufacturers is supplying to global corporations. The 123 Agreement with the United States on civil nuclear cooperation will enable collaboration with leading global companies on new projects. Finally, Indian players can also participate in other parts of the nuclear power equipment value chain like commission et al which amount to 75% of power plant equipment costs \nGiven the sector is dominated by public sector units and other government agencies, private sector participation \nshould be considered. An in-depth study with better involvement of the various government agencies involved in the sector should be undertaken to develop a more detailed perspective. \nconcluSion\nTo achieve these opportunities the government needs to consider three immediate steps: \n Establish direct and indirect offset policies that will help bridge the gaps in domestic investment and drive \ntechnology transfer. \n Consider IT\n and Software capabilities as an enabling mechanism, and create an autonomous professional body to \nmanage IT in the defence, nuclear and aerospace sectors. \n Accelerate the process by which private sector and indigenous participation occurs.l\nllStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear\n\n103introduction\nIndia’s defence, aerospace and nuclear sectors are poised for substantial growth on the back of economic growth \nand the need to maintain national and energy security. A decade ago, India was at a similar inflexion point in the information technology (IT) and IT enabled services (ITES) industry. By capturing the opportunities at hand, the industry increased its contribution to GDP from 1% to 4% over the decade and created many jobs, accounting for up to 45% incremental of job creation (direct and indirect) between 1995 and 2005. Much of this success was due to government policies that helped foster growth. The expansion of this industry offers lessons on key success factors and government policy in guiding the defence, aerospace and nuclear sectors to similar success.\nDriven by geo-political considerations, India is expected to be a top-5 market for defence equipment by 2015. \nSimilarly, economic growth and a focus by commercial aircraft manufacturers on low-cost countries are expected to create growth in the aerospace market in emerging markets in general and India in particular. Finally, the civilian nuclear agreement between the US and India will enable commerce and cooperation, in particular allowing India to collaborate with global companies on nuclear projects. Transnational and multi-national co-development and co-production are on the rise and increasingly seen as critical to competitiveness. India has an opportunity to play an important role in this global phenomenon. \nThe developments described above will create attractive opportunities for the defence, aerospace and nuclear \nsectors in India. \nThe rest of this document describes the context for growth and major trends in each industry and the opportunities \nfor Indian companies. \n\n1041. opportunities in the Defence Sector\nDefence spending has remained concentrated in developed economies, with the United States alone accounting for \n50% of total global spending of USD 1.6 trillion in 2007 (Exhibit 1.1). However, the overall increase in defence spending is heavily weighted towards emerging markets. Between 2002 and 2005, defence spending by Russia and China grew at 18% and 13% respectively, compared to 9.7% in the US. Defence spending in India and Brazil was not much behind that of the US, at 8.6% and 8.3% respectively. \nExhibit 1.1\nDemand in India for defence procurement is increasing and India can be a top-5 market for defence equipment by \n2015. In 2008, India’s budget for defence equipment was USD 9 billion; it is projected at USD 17 billion in 2015, the largest after the United States and China. Indian private sector companies can capture profitable opportunities available in the domestic market if they can tackle several challenges to growth and receive the government support required. \nFoRcES ShaPing ThE gloBal DEFEncE MaRkET\nGlobal defence equipment procurement is expected to reach approximately USD 250 billion in value in 2009 and will increase by around 30% till 2015 (Exhibit 1.2). The following factors will shape demand: \n a \nshift away from traditional, manned platforms in developed markets: The market for traditional platforms \nsuch as aircraft, submarines and land equipment is large, mature and heavily concentrated. The spending on \nthese traditional platforms are likely to decline by 2-5% p.a. Equipment for digital and homeland security and systems for autonomous platforms will be the highest growth areaslStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear\nDefence spending is highly concentrated in large countries\nSource: IISS–Military balance 2007\n\n105an increased focus on asymmetric warfare and expansion of role of iT in defence: \u0018The increase in the number \nof asymmetric conflicts requires agile forces and responsive equipment. Depending on the type of threat, special \nmilitary equipment is required for threat detection and asset protection including nonlethal weapons, unmanned combat air vehicles, early warning systems, vehicle protection equipment and satellites. \nIn addition, the role of IT in defence is expanding with the new focus on cyber security. The US is at the forefront of \ncyber security spending with USD 17 bn approved over the next 5 years and the global market estimate is over USD 8 bn. Defence companies have already begun to acquire niche cyber companies.

However, in recent years, the emphasis has been on \nimproving indigenous defence industry capabilities through local sourcing. This has largely been serviced by the Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) with limited private sector participation. Access to captive domestic demand is a prerequisite of success for defence companies. Other than Israel’s majors, all defence players earn over 75% of revenues from home markets. Furthermore, companies that have successfully globalised with proactive government support typically source more than 70% of requirements domestically. Examples are Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin in the US, which earn around 90% of their revenues in their home market, EADS IN Europe ( 93%), Hindustan Aerospace Limited (97%), Singapore Technologies (63%) and Korean Aerospace Industries (76%). \noPPoRTuniTiES in DESign anD ManuF acTuRing FoR inDian coMP aniES\nTo leverage some of these market trends and also exploit its core competencies, India should focus on:\n Areas with higher technology intensity-Integrated software+hardware play in emerging areas such as homeland \nsecurity, C4ISR, cyber warfare, systems for UAVs\n Focus on technology areas that need to be built domestically as it is unlikely to be transferred by global players \n Areas where \nthe private sector can collaborate and provide superior execution capabilities to Defence Public \nSector Units (DPSUs) such as fabrication \nBased on an extrapolation of the defence expenditure in India as per the Government of India data, the IT services \nspend from the defence industry is estimated to be ~$0.4-$0.5 billion by 2015.

DPSUs have several advantages \nover private players. First, they have additional exemptions from select customs and excise duties. There was a move to extend this benefit to private players under the Raksha Udyog Ratna scheme, but it has not been implemented yet. Second, DPSUs enjoy a preference in pricing.\nTo encourage growth by attracting private investment, the government should initiate implementing the key \nrecommendations from the Kelkar Committee Report on the following areas:\n Provide \na level playing field for private players with the DPSUs by awarding the Raksha Udyog Ratna to deserving \ncompanies; removing nominations and eliminating price and purchase preference clauses for Indian defence \ncontracts.\n Tighten \noffset clauses to provide for more effective technology transfer to India and enlist private sector \nparticipation in utilizing investments/business resulting from the offset clausel\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear\n\n1072. opportunities in aerospace\nDemand for aircraft is surging in emerging markets; India China and Russia are expected to account for 15% of global \ndemand over the next 15 years (Exhibit 2.1). \nExhibit 2.1\nIn addition, air travel is expected to grow at 4% to 5% a year up to 2028 based on historical trends, although growth \nis likely to be erratic due to the cyclical nature of the industry (Exhibit 2.2). \nExhibit 2.2China and India will account for 15% of next 20 years aircraft sales\nSource: Airbus Global Market Forecast, 2004* South West Asia\nSource: IATA, Global Insight economic forecasts (Feb-Mar 2009)Air travel demand has historically been driven by GDP; if this \ncontinues, demand will grow at ~4-5% p.a. to 2028\n4Working Draft - Last Modified 04/11/2009 19:52:31 Printed\n|\n04080120160200240280\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 20250481216RPKs – simple projection \nat 1.6x GDP growthRPKs - HistoricalRPKs - IATA, pre-crisisRPKs - IATA, post-crisisGDP\nSOURCE: IATA, Global Insight economic forecasts (Feb-Mar 2009)1 Revenue passenger kilometers\n2 GDP growth explains 95% of historical RPK growth, based on R2 value of regression. 1% GDP growth has historically driven 1.6% R PK growthAir travel demand has historically been driven by GDP; if this continues, \ndemand will grow at ~4-5% p.a. to 2028\nFirst Gulf war 9/11 Credit crunch\nForecast ActualHistorical \nannual RPK\ngrowth rateForecast\nannual RPK\ngrowth rate\n5% 4-5%Historic and forecast GDP and global air traffic growth\nGDP (real) 2005\nUSD tGlobal \nair traffic,\ntrillions RPK1\nƒHistorically, GDP \ngrowth has been the \nmain driver of air travel \ngrowth2\nƒEconomic forecasters agree that GDP will \ncontinue to rise steadily \nafter this recession\nƒIf air travel demand \nmaintains the same \nrelationship to GDP as \nin the past, this will drive 4-5% p.a. growth in air travel demand to \n2028Exhibit 2.2\n\n108FoRcES ShaPing gRowTh\nThe growth of the commercial aerospace industry will be driven by globalisation and a shift in demand towards light \nmaterials and composites.\nEmerging markets are expected to drive the globalisation of the commercial aerospace industry. Steady growth in \npassenger numbers—~5% globally mainly driven by ~7% growth in the Asia Pacific region—is expected to create strong demand for new aircraft (Exhibits 2.2 and 2.3). India’s commercial fleet is expected to triple in size by 2018. \nExhibit 2.3\nThree factors are driving industry growth in emerging markets:\n The rise \nof new original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in emerging markets due to major commercial aircraft \nprogrammes in these countries (e.g., China, Russia)\n More global \nsourcing and a focus on low-cost countries: Global aerospace players are increasingly offshoring \nengineering and manufacturing in low-cost countries. Canada’s Magellan Aerospace is establishing a low-cost \naerospace processing facility in India. The United States’ Lockheed Martin is looking to set up a team of Indian companies providing IT infrastructure support to the company.\n Outsourcing of \nR&D to emerging markets: Western OEMs have been outsourcing R&D to emerging markets such as \nRussia and China for some time now. These countries have been meeting their requirements through their large \nengineering and aerospace talent pools. \nIncreasing ability of emerging market suppliers to serve western OEMs: China, Russia and to some extent India are able to serve the large aircraft firms Boeing and Airbus as Tier 1/2 suppliers. Many suppliers in emerging markets now have established relationships with western OEMs \nAs development costs are rising, OEMs and super Tier-1 suppliers have started risk-sharing partnerships. Long gestation \nperiods of projects and cost and time over-runs increase the risks of projects. OEMs also want to reduce costs by limiting the number of direct suppliers and want suppliers to invest in design and manufacturing of large work packages. In response, super tier-1 suppliers now provide design, production and integration of major aircraft components.l\nl\nlStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear\nIn the near future passenger numbers are expected to grow annually \nby ~5%, mainly driven by Asia-Pacific with ~7%\nAirline passenger traffic forecast by region \nRPKs thousands1\n1 RPK = Revenue Passenger Kilometers, typical measure for air trafficdemand; numbers are \nrounded esimates\nSource: Bernstein Research\n\n109Finally, the offset requirement in India could stimulate a geographic shift of investment towards India. Offset \nprovisions in India’s defence contracts are applicable to 30% of the total cost of any deal worth over USD 70 million. \nA foreign company is required to buy defence or other specified equipment from Indian companies. Offset requirements are expected to lead to investments worth USD 16 billion in India up to 2024 and could build a niche for India in the aerospace sector. Parts manufacturing and subcomponent assembly are strongly affected by offset regulations, auguring a possible shift in customer bases to emerging markets.\noPPoRTuniTiES FoR inDian PlayERS\nIndian players have at least three opportunities areas:\n avionics, engineering design and software opportunities: The key opportunity for India is in aerospace \nengineering and avionics. This involves six main activities of which a large part of detailed design, testing and software development can be done in India. With a pool of aerospace engineers and a cost advantage over companies in developed economies, India is well placed to attract capacity - and knowledge-driven offshoring. The same factors—talent pool and cost advantage—plus experience in engineering offshoring in other industries also position India well for cost-driven offshoring. \n Parts and sub-systems manufacture: Indian players can consider manufacturing of standard aerospace parts \n(e.g., aerospace grade fasteners, casting etc.) and supply them to Tier I/OEMs. In addition, they can focus on complete design, manufacture and assembly of less-complex sub-systems (e.g., cabin components)\nMaintenance, repair \nand overhauling (MRo) business: With increased outsourcing of MRO, emerging markets \nwill become the preferred location for these services. In Asia, Japan and Korea have emerged as major locations \nfor engine and component MRO. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have become major centres for heavy maintenance. In India, demand for MRO is expected to almost triple, from around USD 600 million in 2008 to approximately USD 1.6 trillion in 2018 (Exhibit 2.4). \nExhibit 2.4l\nl\nlOpportunities in Aerospace\nGrowth in aerospace and defense in India will result in rise in demand for \nafter-market services like MRO* and training\n* Mainrenance, repair and overhaul\nSource: Aerostrategy, MRO in Asia-Pacific and Middle East (November 2006); HAMCO Website; Lundkvist Fleet database \n(2008); press search\n\n110Typically, IT spend comprises between 4-7% of revenues for aerospace companies. Aerospace companies are \nexpected to increase their reliance on outsourced services to make up for technical resource shortfalls and cost reduction opportunities. These outsourcing contracts will cover hardware maintenance, application development/implementation, and data center operations. Further, outsourced IT services areas can comprise about 30 % of the total IT spend. \nThe addressable market for offshore delivery of IT and engineering services in civil aerospace can be $0.6-$1.2 billion \nby 2015. This is based on the following assumptions:\n The commercial \naircraft industry is expected to generate $90 billion in revenues for 2015 (from the current \n$84 billion)\n Typical \nIT spend constitutes 4-7% of revenues while R&D spend constitutes 4-5% of revenues. The engineering \ndesign spend comprises ~30% of the R&D spend\nAn estimated 75% of the IT and R&D design spend is offshoreableThere is a 30% labor cost saving in offshoring of IT or engineering design services\nIt must be recognised that not all this opportunity will be captured by 2015. The industry revenues will be driven by \nhow much of the addressable market is penetrated driven by demand, supply and industry conduct considerations.l\nll\nlStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear\n\n\u0018\u0018\u00183. opportunities in the nuclear Sector\nThe increased focus on environmentally sustainable growth including the global focus on reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions is providing a big impetus to nuclear power development. In India, nuclear power is expected to contribute up to 25% to 50% of power generated by 2050, a massive leap from the current 3%.\nThe 123 agreement between India and the United States opens the way for India to collaborate with international \ninstitutions in nuclear power projects. It is also expected to ease any limitations in the supply of uranium required for planned growth. \nSignificant reactor capacity additions are planned in India. They include an estimated addition of 29 new nuclear \nreactors representing capacity of 20 GWe by 2020. Of these, 11 are expected to be Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors \n(PHWRs) and 5 Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs).\noPPoRTuniTiES FoR inDian PlayERS\nThe main opportunity for Indian manufacturers is collaboration with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited \n(NPCIL) in manufacturing reactor components.\nThe domestic opportunity can be substantial. For example, an approximately 25 per cent of a nuclear power plant \ncost comprises precision-manufactured components (Exhibit 3.1). NPCIL spent over Rs. 3,000 crores to build each of the most recent power plants, Kaiga 3 and 4 (capacity of 220 MWe each). Indian manufacturers could provide NPCIL with reactor core components (e.g., Calandria, a tube and shell thermosiphon reboiler used for distillation or evaporation) or replacement parts (e.g., fuel rods used in fueling machines). More importantly, this represents a significant improvement in costs as a result of developing local suppliers, over 2000 crores saved for TAPS 3 and 4 projects and another 1000+ crores saved for Kaiga 3 and 4 projects. \nAnother opportunity for Indian manufacturers is supplying to global corporations. The 123 Agreement with the United \nStates on civil nuclear cooperation will enable collaboration with leading global companies on new projects. France’s Areva, the United States’ Westinghouse Electric and General Electric, Japan’s Hitachi, and Russia’s atomic energy agency Rosatom are likely to be suppliers for planned projects based on light water reactor (LWR) technology.\nIndian players can also participate in other parts of the nuclear power equipment value chain including commission, \ninstrumentation, electrical and mechanical components and civil work. These amount to 75% of power plant equipment costs.\nchallEngES FoR inDian PlayERS\nIndian players will need to build the following capabilities to capture the opportunities available:\nManufacturing excellence: Nuclear power plant equipment has stringent manufacturing requirements due to the \nhigh safety needs and downtime cost of maintenance. Components must have tolerance levels much more precise than those required of automobile components (e.g., 0.01 micron on a 1-metre part). Meeting these requirements calls for developing manufacturing excellence on all dimensions, which few players in India meet today .\nMeasurement and testing capability: Manufacturers with demonstrated measurement and testing capabilities \nor those willing to invest in developing them stand to win long-term contracts. Manufacturers will need new measuring equipment (e.g., Talyrond) and new process to perform newer non-destructive testing (e.g., acoustic emissions). Furthermore, inspections may be needed for 100% of the output compared to the sampling approach used in high-volume manufacturing. In addition, certain components take a long time to build. For example, building the entire machining process for a grid plate could take more than a year. Recognising the investments \ninvolved and the risks of poor quality, NPCIL prefers to work with a small number of trusted suppliers.l\nl\n\n112ability to forge long-term partnerships in a consolidated industry: An important success factor would be the \nability to forge long-term partnerships with global suppliers. They operate through one of two models. The first \nis fully integrated manufacturing (as practised by Areva), where the firm controls end-to-end manufacturing with contract-based outsourcing to third parties. The second is an open partnership-based ecosystem (as followed by General Electric), which involves open end-to-end cooperation with third parties across all aspects of the process (from design to manufacturing to service). Indian manufacturers aspiring to participate in the nuclear component industry will need to forge these relationships. For example, GE and Areva are likely to require over 40 million fuelling pins over the next 4-5 years, all of which could be produced in India, representing a significant domestic and expert opportunity. \nconcluSionS \nGiven the size of the aerospace, defence and nuclear market opportunity and current momentum among the private sector players and potential investors, the government has an opportunity to develop a highly strategic and competitive domestic IT industry. It is important to understand that the nature of competition in these industries is not perfectly competitive with significant barriers to trade based on security, economic and geo-political considerations. Industry structure plays an important role in ensuring an efficient and effective industry conduct. In the United States 22 companies were effectively consolidated into four large organizations (Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing and Raytheon), similarly in Europe the merger of 21 companies resulted in the development of 5 major firms (EADS, Thales, FINMICCANICA, Dassault Av and BAE Systems) and in Russia there are now 5 as well. There is a clear need for change in several areas to take advantage of this significant opportunity. To facilitate this we suggest the government consider several immediate next steps including:\n1) E\nstablish Direct and Indirect Offset policies that addresses five specific areas that will help rapidly fill gaps \nin domestic investment and assist in technology transfer. These are: a) Co-Production (including for IT and \ncontrol systems where India has clear capabilities), b) Licensing Agreements, c) Local Installation & Assembly, \nd) Transfer of Technology, e) Purchase of components from India (including nuclear, aerospace and defence related IT and software). \n A \nfew important considerations in implementing offset policies must be considered - offsets should be triggered \nabove a specific RFP value; consistent with recommendations already made an offset of 30% remains reasonable; special post- contract monitoring mechanisms should be put in place (similar to the 2002 Defence Procurement Procedure) to ensure offsets are genuinely used to build new and critical capabilities.\n2) Consider \nIT and Software capabilities as an enabling mechanism. Significant changes are required to reform \ncurrent organization and acquisition practices and fix issues such as the mismatch between technological planning & development and R&D, production agencies and users in defence (by example). In addition to the direct role IT and Software industries can play in fulfilling R&D requirements, the industry can provide a platform to improve efficiency and coordination through fast and accurate information availability across the value chain of participants – both public and private, domestic and foreign, while ensuring security concerns are met. \n3) Accelerate \nprocess by which private sector and indigenous participation happens. For an area such as defence it \nwill be critical to address at least four areas: a) inclusion of private sector in “make” and “buy and make” category of equipment, b) guidelines for participation in “make” category items, c) clarify procurement procedures and d) specifically identify areas such as systems integration, monitoring and test capabilities, that leverages the well established capabilities of indigenous IT and Software players. \n4) For \nIT in defence, nuclear and aerospace sectors in particular create an autonomous professional body that is \ninvolved with crafting and executing RFPs/tenders for IT-specific projects/contracts.lStrategic Electronics – Defence, Aerospace and Nuclear",

The \ngrowth of the net work services had been going on at an explosive \nrate and the time has come for stream lining of the e -mail services by \nadopting a single virtual e -mail server for the who le nation and \nachieving address resolution in such an environment. The present \nVersion 1.0 of the “NIC Policy on e -mail address” is a step in that \ndirection. \n \n2. Applicability: This policy is applicable to all the users of the NICNET \nservices. \n \n3. e-mail Address Policy: The major problem that is to be resolved in \ngiving the e -mail addresses to the users is to ensure the address \nresolution when multiple similar names occur, which is a common \noccurrence. This problem is found to occur in every nation and \ntherefore there are some proven name resolution methods that have \nbeen used by many of the service providers. There are two major \nnaming methods that are used in India. In some parts of India, the \n“surname” or the “family name” is used to address a person. In some \nother parts (though in a few states) the “given name” is used for \naddressing a person. In one state, one gets to see the usage of a \nlarge number of initials attached to a given name. Therefore, unlike in \nthe west, where the naming mechanism is uniform, we n eed to take \nthe differences in the naming mechanism to be reflected in the e -mail \naddresses so that the address resolution problem is properly taken \ncare of on an All India Basis. \n\n4. Policy for Address Resolution: The policy refers to both the e -mail \ndomai ns, which shall be virtual e -mail domains, and the e -mail \naddresses. \n4.1 e-mail addresses: The e -mail addresses shall have a single domain \nby default “gov.in” and no sub names as in the past. That is all the e -\nmail addresses that shall be operative over the N ICNET shall have \nthe same unified address part as “@gov.in” Therefore any e -mail \naddress given any where in India over the NICNET shall have the \nsame unified address part “@gov.in” \n4.2 e-mail Addresses: The address will have only two parts and in \nspecial case s, only one part. That is the address would look like \naaaa.bbbb@gov.in . The first part “aaaa” can be either a given name \nor a family name. The second part “bbbb” will be comprising of either \nall initials put together o r a family name or given name as the case \nmay be. Below are given a few names that may cause address \nresolution problems and the proposed method of allocating e -mail \naddresses is presented. A few examples are given below to illustrate \nthe procedure that wo uld be adopted in allocating the e -mail \naddresses: \n4.2.1. Rakesh Kumar Sehgal \nRakesh Kumar Saxena \nHere, the two e -mail addresses would be: \nsehgal.rk@gov.in \nsaxena.rk@gov.in \n \n4.2.2. Rakesh Kumar \nRakesh Kumar \nRakesh Kumar \nHere, the three e -mail addresses would be: \nrakesh.k@gov.in \nkumar.r@gov.in \nrakesh.kumar@gov.in \n\n4.2.3. In spe cial cases where more than three persons have the same \nname Rakesh Kumar, then the name of the place where he is \nworking, or the place where he belongs to, or even a number \nwould be added as the additional part based on the user \ndiscretion. That is, the e -mail address would be \n“rakesh.kumar.agra@gov.in ” i.e. name.{dept/min}@gov.in . \nNOTE: Two character state codes (as per ISO 3166; ref - \nAppendix - 1) and Four character (2 for state and 2 for districts \nwithin state) district codes (as per ISO 3166 -2; ref – Appendix 2) \nmay be used while adding suffix or domain name abbreviation, \nwhenever required. In cases where abbreviations are available \nfrom census of India, i s also a valid candidate for this purpose \nbased on the user preference. \n4.2.4. S.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy \nHere the e -mail address would be: \nramanamurthy.sbpv@gov.in \n \n4.2.5. S.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy \nS.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy \nS.B.P.V.Ramana Murthy \nHere the three e -mail addresses will be: \nramana.murthy@gov.in \nramanamurthy.sbpv@gov.in \nmurthy.ramana@gov .in \n \n5. The existing e -mail addresses will be mapped to the corresponding \nnew e -mail addresses and would co -exist till a date that is pre -\ndecided. After that date, only new addresses would become operative. \nIt is also possible to maintain the old e -mail addre sses and the new e -\nmail address. All outgoing mails will take the new address and system \n\nwill still accept the mails coming to the old e -mail address for a pre -\ndefined time. \n \n6. Official Addresses/E -mail address for different Govt. Offices : \nSome conventions h ave to be followed as shown below. \n1.Joint-Secretary Ministry of Finance --- js-finance/js -dept-finance \n2.Addl-Secretary Ministry of Finance --- as-finance/as -dept-finance \n3.Secretary Ministry of Finance --- secy-finance \n4.Police Commissioner \n5.Resident Commissioner \n6. …. \n7. …. \nThese addresses are official positions and will remain permanent. These \naddresses may be mapped to the actual person who is holding the \npresent position. When a new person comes to the same position on \ntransfer, the mapping will be cha nged to new person e -mail id. \n\nAppendix (1) \nSTATE Abbreviations (2 -3 character abbreviation for States(s) and \nUnion territories of India; As per ISO 3166).

ISA is now releasing a study \non the Indian semiconductor design industry \nin collaboration with Ernst & Young India and \nwith the active participation and support of \nDepartment of Information Technology, DIT, \nGovernment of India.\nThe current report is divided into three sections \n— the industry analysis, benchmarking of India; \nand recommendations. Industry analysis focuses \non the Indian industry. It discusses the ecosystem \nfor semiconductor design development in \nareas ranging from intellectual property, talent \nlandscape to the key drivers and challenges. \nThe quantitative benchmarking compares various \nparameters such as industry dynamics, talent \npool, infrastructure, operating costs, quality \nof business environment and innovation and \nintellectual property which are important for the \ndevelopment of semiconductor design sector in \na country. \nFinally, based on the findings of these two \nsections, key issues constraining the growth \nof the semiconductor design industry are summarized based on which elaborate \nrecommendations are articulated. \nGovernment and industry need to reflect on these \nrecommendations. Together, we can ensure that \nIndia continues to benefit, grow and prosper from \na sector that is marked by innovation and a desire \nfor world-class performance.\nThe concerted efforts of the EY team comprising \nSunil Bhumralkar, Sunil Shenoy, Balasubramanian \nGurunathan, N Kamalanand, Santosh Premdas, \nSwapnil Srivastava, Sachin Mehta and Amit \nMahendru to meet the timelines of the study are \ngreatly appreciated. The industry core committee \nhas given their time and inputs for the study. \nProf. Jamadagni (Indian Institute of Science) has \nalso spared us his time for the report. Our thanks \nto these individuals. Rajiv Jain and Dr. Vidya \nMulky from the Secretariat coordinated \nthe process.\nWe would especially like to acknowledge \nthe Department of IT (DIT), Ministry of \nCommunication and Information Technology \n(MCIT), Government of India for supporting the \nreport at every stage to conduct this initiative.\nPoornima Shenoy \nPresident, ISA Dr. Pradip K Dutta \nChairman, ISA\n\n7\n Executive \nsummaryExecutive summary\nKey excerpts from the three sections of the report are provided below\n1) Industry analysis: The finding of the industry \nanalysis demonstrates the growth of the Indian \nsemiconductor industry, which comprises VLSI design, \nembedded software development and hardware/\nboard design, and had an estimated value of US$ 7.5 \nbillion in 2010. Increasing consumer electronic goods \nsales, a burgeoning telecom/networking market and \nsignificant growth in the use of portable/wireless \nproducts is a trend being seen in India, which is driving \nthe growth of the semiconductor design industry.\n• Overall semiconductor industry drivers and \nchallenges: Adequate availability of the talent \npool, the maturity of the Indian semiconductor \nindustry and stringent IP protection measures \nare driving this industry, but the lack of a \nsemiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and of \nquality in specialized skills, competition from other \nAsian countries and eroding cost advantage are \nseen as major challenges. Venture capital activity, \nespecially at the seed fund stage, is still not as \nmature as in the IT/ITeS industry.\n• India’s talent scenario: India’s abundant talent \npool continues to play a major role in the country’s \nposition in global semiconductor design vertical, \nwhich employed a workforce of 160,000 in 2010. \nThe industry has a young workforce with close to \n78% consisting of B.Tech graduates and close to \n60% with less than eight years of work experience. \nHowever, the lack of product conceptualization and \nmanagement as well as analog design skills are \nsome talent-related challenges that need to \nbe addressed.\n• VLSI design: Almost 50% of the work conducted in \nVLSI design is in the gate range of 1M–10M, and \nmore than 50% of the work is carried out in the \ndigital design segment, but mixed signal design \nwork is rapidly increasing. In terms of design, IP \ndevelopment and module design and verification \ngarner the major share of projects. The main \ngrowth drivers include:\n• The increasing maturity of the Indian design \necosystem\n• The rising demand for electronics products \nglobally, which is driving VLSI industry\nSome of the notable challenges in this segment:\n• Lack of scale at the leading node \n• Lack of R&D funding in universities. • Embedded software design: The embedded software \nindustry contributes close to 80% to the Indian \nsemiconductor industry’s revenues, with the key \nconsuming verticals being telecom/networking and \nconsumer electronics products. Factors that provide \nan impetus to this segment include:\n• Product customization due to localization and \nlegislative requirements\n• Lower entry barriers\n• Adaption to open-source platforms \nThe main challenges faced in the embedded \nsoftware segment include:\n• Cost pressures due to constantly evolving \nplatforms\n• Skill-set availability for high-end programmers \n• Preference for ADM services as a career option\n• Hardware/Board design: The hardware/board \nsegment is the smallest contributor to the \nsemiconductor design industry in India. More than \n50% of the work is conducted in the sub-10 layers \nrange. Factors that aid in the growth of this segment \ninclude: \n• Increased outsourcing by service providers\n• Re-engineering opportunities \n• Captives partnering third-party service providers \nand bringing in increased business\nThis segment is hindered in growth by the following:\n• Compliance-related challenges\n• Lack of semiconductor ecosystem\n2) Benchmarking study: This study was \nconducted with the aim to quantitatively compare India \nwith seven other countries, which are considered the \npioneers in semiconductor design, on the parameters \nrelevant for this industry. The representative set \nof countries chosen consists of the US, the UK, \nGermany, Sweden, China, Taiwan and Israel. The 20 \nbenchmarking parameters that were considered for the \nstudy are important for the development of a country’s \nsemiconductor design sector. These parameters can \nbe broadly classified under the following heads — \nindustry dynamics, talent pool, innovation environment, \noperating cost, infrastructure and the quality of the \nbusiness environment. \nThe following are the key findings from the \nbenchmarking exercise:\n\n• Industry dynamics: India has a fairly well-\ndeveloped semiconductor design industry, with \n120 design units. Several global integrated device \nmanufacturers (IDMs) have established their \ncaptive design centers in the country, which ranks \nthe second among the sample set of countries \nin terms of design revenues. The country’s \nelectronics market is growing rapidly and is \nexpected to boost the demand for semiconductor \ncomponents in the future.\n• Talent pool: India is a strong performer on its \ntalent parameters and features among the top \nthree in the sample set in terms of the engineers \nemployed in its semiconductor design sector. This \nis due to the required degree graduates being \nproduced each year, who have the requisite skills \nto be employed in the country’s design sector. \nIndia also has the highest number of engineering \ncolleges among the sample set of countries.\n• Innovation environment: India is seeing rapid \nevolution in its innovation environment due to \nthe availability of its skilled talent pool and high-\nquality scientific research institutes. The country \nranks favorably among the sample set countries in \nterms of the number of IEEE papers filed by it in \nthe fields relevant for semiconductor design. India \nhowever lags behind other sample set countries in \nterms of company spending on R&D. \n• Operating cost: India is highly competitive in terms \nof operating costs for businesses and ranks among \nthe top few in the sample set in terms of the \nsalaries of semiconductor design professionals and \nGrade A office space rentals, which form a major \nportion of a company’s costs. In terms of the cost \nof raising debt and electricity costs, India ranks \namong last countries in the sample set, although \nboth these parameters do not comprise a major \nportion of the operating costs of companies. \n• Infrastructure: India ranks among the top \ncountries in the sample set in terms of its future \navailability of office space. However, the country’s \neconomy is still power-deficient. On the positive \nside, in the last few years, India has overcome \nits internet bandwidth constraints and now has \nample capacity to provide high-speed international \nconnectivity to companies.• Quality of business environment: India lags behind \nother countries in the sample set in terms of the \noverall quality of its business environment. There \nare innumerable procedures required to start a \nnew business in the country. Corporate taxation \nrate in India is also among the highest in the \nsample set, but the country performs better than \nother developing countries in the sample set in \nterms of the efficiency of its legal framework.\n3) Recommendations for the Indian \nsemiconductor design industry: Based on \nthe findings of the industry analysis and benchmarking \nexercise, the key challenges constraining the growth of \nthe semiconductor design industry are \nsummarized below:\ni. Quality, availability and maturity of talent\nii. Absence of a start-up and SME ecosystem\niii. Lack of a semiconductor ecosystem\niv. Lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and \nimplementable incentives\nv. External issues affecting the Indian semiconductor \nindustry\nEach of these issues has been tackled in detail, \nwith detailed recommendations in this report. \nThese recommendations require the concerted and \ncoordinated effort of the Government, industry and \nthe academia to help India reach the next level of \ngrowth and achieve the specific goals envisaged for \nthe Indian semiconductor design industry, which \ninclude the following:\nMaintain leadership in semiconductor design by \nincubating 50 fabless semiconductor companies, \neach with the potential to grow to US$ 200 million \nin annual revenues by 2020Goal 1\nBuild on India's favorable intellectual property protection image and make it among the top 5 \ndestinations for intellectual property creation in \nthe semiconductor design industry Goal 2\nCapitalize on indigenous demand in strategic sectors to provide impetus to the Indian fabless \nsemiconductor industry Goal 3\nSustain and nurture high-class semiconductor design \nmanpower at a growth rate of 20% year-on-year to \ndouble its current output levels to reach a workforce \nsize of 400,000 in the next ﬁve yearsGoal 4\n\nThis study on the Indian semiconductor and embedded design services industry has been \ncommissioned by the Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communication \nand Information Technology, India, with the intention of providing a thorough and \nsystematic analysis of the Industry. It highlights India’s growth and positioning in the \nglobal semiconductor design industry to identify areas of improvement and frame \nrecommendations for the Indian semiconductor design industry. This report is jointly \nprepared by the India Semiconductor Association and Ernst & Young Pvt. Ltd. \nThe output of the study is presented in three sections:About this study\nSection 1: Industry analysis\nThis section throws light on the global semiconductor design and embedded software \nindustry with a focus on the Indian industry. It discusses the ecosystem for semiconductor \ndesign development, the status of intellectual property in the industry and the talent \nlandscape.

As illustrated below, from a worldwide base \nsemiconductor market of US$ 226 billion in 2009, the industry enables the generation of \nelectronics systems and services, which account for about 10% of the total world GDP.\nMoore’s Law, based on the observation made by Intel Co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, is a \nprinciple, which states that the number of transistors per square inch on Integrated Circuits \n(ICs) had doubled every year since ICs were first invented. Moore predicted that this trend \nwould continue for the foreseeable future. Semiconductor designers shrink the transistors \non chips so that electrons have less distance to travel, which expedite processing of data. \nThis method is becoming harder to perform, as circuits are packed so closely that chips are \nheating up and their performance is beginning to suffer.

While \nthe market growth rate of the industry is slowing down, costs within it are not. Furthermore, \ncontinued technology convergence or integration is leading to an increase in the complexity \nof devices, which is escalating design costs. Additionally, it is predicted that continued \nintegration is likely to cause certain standalone chip markets to become inconsequential \nas individual functions are fused into bigger chips, which is expected to result in a smaller \nnumber of chip types being produced by fewer vendors. This is likely to lead to further \nconsolidation in the industry over the next few years.\nThe industry is research- and development-intensive at the design stage and capital-intensive \nduring the manufacturing phase. This is accompanied by continuous growth in a cyclical \npattern with high volatility. Generally, cycles include an expansion and peak period, followed \nby a slowdown phase, and eventually a downturn stage, as illustrated in the figure below. \nThe industry has witnessed six major cycles since 1970, and there is good reason to believe \nthat 2009 marked the end of the downturn phase of another cycle. These cycles and their \nvolatility have meant that players in the industry are aware of the critical need for a high \ndegree of flexibility and innovation to constantly adjust to the rapid pace of change in the \nmarket.\nExhibit 3: Cyclical nature of global semiconductor industry\nExpansion and \npeak phase\n2–3 years of strong \n(20%) growth\nExpansion and \npeak phase\nSource: EY research 2010Downturn \nphase\n1-1–2 years\nof ﬂat or \ndeclining \ngrowth\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry16\nCurrent global semiconductor \nindustry \nThere has been a drastic fall in the year-on-year growth of the global semiconductor \nindustry, beginning in 2008, with a maximum decline of 9.0% in 2009. Initial estimates \nindicated less significant revenues of US$ 219.7 billion in 2009, but the industry had \nevolved since the earlier 2001 boom-bust period and was quick to adapt to prevailing \nconditions. Therefore, it witnessed higher-than-expected revenues of US$ 226.3 billion in \n2009.\nSome factors that initially led to this decline over 2008–2009 included: \n• Fall in end-market demand \nFalling demand in almost all semiconductor end markets had a huge impact on industry \nrevenues. While the communications industry saw less significant growth rates of \n5.8%, as compared to 7.9% earlier, the automotives industry was not as fortunate and \nwitnessed a fall of 14.9%. Almost all end markets saw a decline or lower growth rates, \nresulting in an overall fall in the demand for semiconductors as well\n• External macroeconomic factors \nDifficult macroeconomic conditions due to the recession led to lower disposable \nincomes, and hence, lower consumer consumption, which played a key role in falling \nsemiconductor revenues. The global economic crisis had a profoundly negative impact on \nalmost all industries, including the semiconductor industry\n• Cyclical behavior \nThe cyclic nature of the industry may also have been responsible for the decline in \n2008–2009. This would suggest that the last quarter of 2009 was leading into the \nupturn period that follows a dip in the semiconductor industry cycle. The dip may have \nbeen too short to be considered part of a regular cycle, but these cycles are getting \nshorter in length due to the rapid inventory re-adjustments that are now possible and the \nbuffer that fab-less companies have when they outsource their manufacturing operation \nto third-party foundries. \nThe recessionary impact is clearly seen in the graph above, indicating that there was decline \nof 2.8% in 2008 and a further decline of 9% in 2009.Exhibit 4: Global semiconductor industry\nSource: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), 2009227248256\n249\n2266.8%8.9%\n3.2%-2.8%\n-9.0%\n-10%-5%0%5%10%\n210220230240250260\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Growth (%)USD billions\nRevenues GrowthII.\n\n17 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nIndustry segmentation by product category\nThe overall semiconductor industry is fairly fragmented and each segment or sub-segment \nhas its own group of key competitors. The following trends have been observed in the \nvarious segments of the industry:\n• ► Discrete semiconductors — diodes, transistors, etc. \n• These typically perform a single function in electronic circuits, the purpose of which \nis switching, amplifying or rectifying and transmitting electrical signals. The discrete \nsegment is expected to grow from US$ 14.2 billion to US$ 21.6 billion during 2009–\n2012. The growth of the segment is usually quite stable, relative to the overall industry, \ndue to its lower presence in computer applications\n• ► Optoelectronics — electrical/ optical or optical/ electrical transducers \n• This is a separate segment as different technology and processes are required \nto manufacture optoelectronics, as compared to integrated circuits or discrete \nsemiconductors. The optoelectronics segment is expected to grow from US$ 17.0 billion \nto US$ 26.8 billion during 2009–2012. This growth is expected to be mainly driven by \nthe use of optoelectronics in digital cameras, and especially in cameras in multimedia \nmobiles and handsets\n• ► Sensors — sense physical quantity and convert it to electrical signals.\n• Although a relatively small segment of the overall industry, sensors are expected to see a \nsizeable growth from US$ 4.8 billion in 2009 to US$ 7.9 billion in 2012. The increasing \nneed for sensors in digital applications, which may have previously been analog, should \nbe a strong driver of growth for the segment.\n• ► Integrated circuits (ICs) — miniaturize electronic circuits, integrating a large numbers of \ntiny transistors into a small chip \n• Integrated circuits comprise the bulk of the semiconductor industry, accounting for \naround 84% of the industry in 2009. The discrete segment has become a smaller \nsegment as an increasing number of integrated circuits can perform the functions carried \nout by Integrated circuits. The segment has sub-segments including analog, memory, \nmicro and logic components. It is expected to grow from US$ 190.3 billion in 2009 to \nUS$ 275.0 billion in 2012.\nExhibit 5: Split of semiconductor revenues by segment, 2009\nSource: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)Discrete\n6%Optoelectronics\n8%Sensors\n2%\nAnalog\n14%Micro\n21%\nLogic\n29%Memory\n20%Integrated \ncircuits\n84%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry18\nGeographic distribution of global semiconductor market\nThe Asia Pacific continues to be the largest market for semiconductors, garnering almost \nhalf the global semiconductor market. During the global recession, sales in the Asia Pacific \nremained flat, whereas that in the Americas and Europe witnessed a steep decline. Worldwide \nsemiconductor growth in recent years has been largely driven by the increasing demand \nfor consumer electronics such as portable music players, mobile phones and flat screen \ntelevisions. With many of these products being manufactured in Asia, along with growing \nconsumption electronics in these countries, explains why sales to this region are so large. \nThe Asia-Pacific region surpassed the Americas to become the world’s largest region for \nsemiconductor sales in 2001, and since then, its lead has increased every year.\nKey end vertical consumption trends and demand evolution\nThese various segments of the semiconductor industry lead to their various applications in end \nmarkets ranging from consumer electronics to communications.\nThe following are the key end market growth drivers: Exhibit 6: Geographic split of global semiconductor market, 2009\nSource: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)South Korea\n4.5%India\n5.1%Rest of \nAPAC\n5.2%\nEurope\n13.0%Americas\n17.0%Japan\n17.0% China\n38.1%\nAsia–Paciﬁc \n(APAC)\n52.9%\nExhibit 7: Geographic growth trends of the global semiconductor market, 2005-2010E\nSource: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)-30.0%-20.0%-10.0%0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010EYear -on-year growth rate (%)\nAmericas Europe Japan Asia Paciﬁc\n\n19 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \n• Data processing market \nThis market has seen strong demand from emerging countries while witnessing a \nrecovery in sales in enterprise sector through new products. The benefits of these new \nproducts are driving hardware upgrades among enterprises. However, the main growth \ndriver in the computing market is expected to be mobile computing platforms. The \ngrowth of the cloud computing and data center segments may also play a significant role\n• Consumer electronics market \nKey products such as LCD TVs and blu-ray players are also a major driver of revenue, \neven with their low margins. These margins are the result of aggressive pricing due to \nthe intense competition in the market. The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has \nindicated that the fall in revenue in 2009 was the result of weak pricing as actual unit \nvolumes of consumer goods increased. There is also expected to be a general global \ntrend of switching from analogue to digital broadcasting of TV signals, driving the growth \nin high-resolution TVs and digital set top boxes\n• Automotive industry \nThe increased need for, e.g., navigation and fuel efficiency for vehicles in the automotive \nindustry, is driving the growth for electronic content per vehicle. As automobiles have a \nlonger lifespan than consumer goods, semiconductors for automobiles tend to generate \nrevenue for a number of years, realizing a stable business model with a strong growth \nprofile for the future\n• Communications \nThe growth in cell phone sales has led to that of semiconductors such as analog \nchips and microcontrollers, which are used in wireless communication. According to \nInternational Data Corporation (IDC), the key drivers in this segment include higher \nconnectivity, increased storage and multimedia-enabled handsets and smartphones.\n• Industrial \nEnvironmental-friendly technology, as well as energy-efficient technologies such \nas smart meters and smart grid, is driving the growth of the industrial segment. \nSemiconductors in this segment are mainly focused in the areas of control and power, \nand the largest number of installed components include logic, MCUs and DSPs.\nExhibit 8: End-vertical consumption, global semiconductor market, 2009\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010Data \nprocessing\n39.6%Communications\n24.2%Consumer \nelectronics\n19.6%\nAutomotive\n5.4%\nIndustrial\n11.2%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry20\nKey drivers of and challenges faced by global \nsemiconductor industry\nDrivers\nAlthough consumer electronics and computers were the drivers of industry growth during \nthe earlier part of this decade, they have now paved the way for other key drivers of growth. \n• Key products and applications\n• Portable mobile devices and smart-phones \nAs various applications of mobile devices increase, the communications end market \nis the most likely to replace consumer electronics and computers in furthering the \nindustry’s growth.\n• Electric cars \nThe production of electric cars is on the rise, and the global focus on energy \nefficiency should lead to rising production levels. Semiconductors, which enhance \nthe practicality of these cars, e.g., increased battery efficiency, are expected to lead \nthe way.\n• Medical and healthcare applications \nWith an augmented healthcare applications industry and personal home healthcare \napplications, there should be a significant increase in the need for semiconductors in \nthese applications as well.\n• ► Key areas\n• Energy efficiency \nRenewable energy in the form of solar panels, etc., is expected to be at the \nforefront with increasing global awareness of the need to conserve energy. \nSemiconductors are likely to play a big role in electrical energy creation by \nenhancing the design of solar panels.\n• Embedded intelligence \nWhile driving consumer growth, these are also critical for generating opportunities \nfor convergence.\n• Sensors and detectors \nThe need for security and related applications in the modern world, as well \nas its requirement for sensors and detectors, should be the growth driver for \nsemiconductors as well.\n\n21 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nChallenges\nAlthough the semiconductor industry is being driven by so many different factors, there are \nstill some major issues faced by the industry. Some of these include:\n• Timing of delivery of products \nThe timing of delivery in some segments such as consumer electronics and mobile \ndevices is crucial because of the fast-changing nature of the demand for these products — \nthe demand for a current chip may begin to dip rapidly and delays in delivery would mean \nsubstantial loss of profits as well as market reputation.\n• Technology changes \nRapid technology changes, increasing complexity and the increasingly complex \nequipment required to cope with these changes result in high costs.\n• Prices \nFalling prices due to fierce competition, commoditization and rising pressures from OEMs \nfor lower prices have led to declining profit margins.\n• Macroeconomic conditions \nA weak economy or end market conditions may result in falling demand.\nGlobal semiconductor industry projections\nAlthough the industry was heavily impacted by the recession in 2009, the sharpest decline it \nhas seen since 2001, forecasts for 2010 were very encouraging, with a year-on-year growth \nof 28.6% and projected revenues of US$291 billion. According to reports, these forecasts \nare on track with semiconductor sales exceeding expectations. Some of the key factors that \nare driving this growth include:\n• Production cuts \nSemiconductor manufacturers are increasingly aware of the risk of excess stock after \nthe boom bust of 2001. As soon as the recession began taking effect in late 2008, \nmanufacturers responded by drastically cutting their production levels instead of running \ntheir production lines at full capacity with the hope of maintaining their margins when \nthe recession died down. Consequently, there was no excess stock; in some cases a \nshortage was seen, which, in turn, led to higher pricing.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry22\n• Consumer electronics and PC markets \nThe return to strength in consumer electronics and PC markets toward the end of the \nyear accounts for around 60% of global semiconductors sales. New product launches, \ne.g., of netbooks and more complex chip content in products such as LCD TVs, \ncontributed to the process.\n• Increasingly diverse end markets \nThe global shift toward energy efficiency and alternative energy is driving and creating \nsemiconductor sales in emerging markets (as well as in medical equipment).\n• Pricing \nEffective inventory management during the recession meant that there was a supply \nshortage, given the demand. This created an upward pressure on prices, which rose \nsignificantly.\nIt is also important to note that the phenomenal industry growth of 28.6% was just a return \nto normal growth in 2010, but seems inflated in comparison with recession-impacted 2009 \nfigures. If compared to 2007 revenues of US$ 256 billion, 2010 figures represent a more \nstandard growth of 13.7%.\nExhibit 9: Global semiconductor industry projections\n226291 307320\n-9.0%28.6%\n5.6% 4.2%\n-15%-10%-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%\n050100150200250300350\n2009 2010 2011 2012Growth (%)USD billions\nRevenues Growth\nSource: Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), 2009\n\n23 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nIndian semiconductor industry \noverviewIII.\nEvolution of semiconductor design industry in India\nThe semiconductor industry was initiated in India in the late sixties with the establishment \nof discrete semiconductor device R&D and manufacturing in the Germanium and Silicon \ntechnologies, and the first saleable integrated circuits (both digital and analog) were made \nand marketed. This marked the country’s first step toward semiconductor R&D and led to \nthe establishment of global incumbent semiconductor companies such as Texas Instruments \n(1985) and Arcus (acquired by Cypress Semiconductor). The evolution of the domestic \nsemiconductor design industry can be classified into four phases.\na. The exploratory phase (Pre1995): This phase saw the initiation of semiconductor \ndesign in India with the establishment of state-run companies, which produced discrete \nGermanium semiconductors and some multi-national companies such as Texas \nInstruments, which were looking to test the Indian waters and were the first movers in \ntapping the Indian opportunity.\nb. The IT industry-led growth phase (1995 –2000): With the growth of the domestic IT \nindustry in India, coupled with the increasing number of English-speaking engineers,, an \necosystem developed, which led to the entry of an increasing number of domestic and \nMNC companies such as Analog Devices, National Semiconductor, Delphi Automotive \nSystems and Synopsys.\nc. Explosive growth phase (2000 –2005): This phase marked the highest growth of \nsemiconductor design companies in India, which led to the establishment/entry of about \n42% of the companies currently operating in the country. This was primarily driven by \nstrong government support and rapidly evolving educational institutions, which began \noffering advanced courses in semiconductor design.\nd. Innovation phase (2005 onwards): With the top 10 global cable companies and the \ntop 25 semiconductor companies present in India, the ecosystem is gradually orienting \ntoward product/ design innovation. Both captives and non-captives are gradually \norienting themselves to execute projects of enhanced strategic value (toward spec-to-\ntape out/ product ownership).\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry24\nBy 2005, a large number of global semiconductor companies had set up captive design units \nin India, which explains the peak in the number of companies established before 2005 as \nshown below.\nCurrent and future semiconductor design industry size \nin India\nThe semiconductor design industry in India, consisting of VLSI design, board/hardware \ndesign and embedded software development, was estimated to be US$ 6.5 billion in 2009 \nand is expected to log a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% over the next three years \nto reach US$ 10.6 billion in 2012. The major contributor to these revenues is embedded \nsoftware development, followed by VLSI and board design. The increasing availability \nof a capable talent pool, coupled with the emergence of India as a consumer market for \nelectronic goods, has led to the increase in work being done to India.Source: ISA—EY research 2010Exhibit 10: Evolution of Semiconductor Design Companies in India by \nnumber of companies and year of incorporation (cumulative growth)\n1018357088\n711173240\n37183848\n<1990 <1995 <2000 <2005 <2009\nAll companies Third -party service providers Captives\nSource: ISAExhibit 11: Semiconductor design industry in India, 2009-12\n827 944 1,108 1,333417 4765586725,3196.6 b7.5 b8.8 b10.6 b\n6,0767,1278,579\n02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,000\n2009 2010 2011 2012USD millions\nVLSI Design Board design Embedded software development17.3%\n\n25 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nKey consuming industry segments and demand evolution\nThe increasing sale of consumer electronic good, a burgeoning telecom/networking market \nand the growth in the use of portable/ wireless products globally, a trend which is also being \nseen in India, is driving the growth of the semiconductor design industry in the country. \nToday, end users demand a lot more from a particular electronic product in terms of its \nstand-alone functionality, cross product integration, connectivity and emergence of new \ntechnologies such as LED screens, 3G and Wi-Max. This translates into an increased demand \nfor semiconductor design. Increasing markets for such products in India has given rise to an \nemergent trend, with companies looking at domestic companies for semiconductor design \nservices, since these have better market knowledge and understanding.\nAutomobile electronics is another key growth area, since passenger and industrial vehicles \nare both getting increasingly “smarter” with on-board computer systems, used to enhance \nsafety and the customer experience.\nImpact of Indian semiconductor design industry on India\nThe semiconductor design industry has contributed significantly to the country’s economy.\nIn addition to fueling India’s economy, this industry is also positively influencing the lives \nof its people through its active direct and indirect contribution to various socio-economic \nparameters such as employment, standard of living, education and diversity, among others.Source: ISAExhibit 12: Semiconductor Design Projects Split by Consuming Industry \nSegment, 2009\nTelecom/networking \nproducts\n30.77\nIndustrial/power \nelectronics products \n4.43Portable/ \nwireless products \n15.07Consumer \nelectronics \nproducts\n34.43Automobile products\n4.37Healthcare\n3.87Storage\n4.30\nOthers\n2.77\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry26\nThe impact can be assessed for some of the parameters provided below:\nContribution to the \neconomy\nGeneration of employment \nplatform\nOther economic impact\nBridging the gender divide\nInvestment in R&DThe ratio of the industry’s output to India’s GDP is an important indicator \nof its impact on the country’s economy. The semiconductor design \nindustry contributes around 0.5% to India’s economy and this is expected \nto increase further.\nOther economic contributions include growing exports boosting \nforeign exchange earnings, strong tax contributions, attracting PE/VC \ninvestments and development of tier 1 cities.\nThe semiconductor design industry has helped to bridge the gender \ndivide in the Indian workforce by ensuring a healthy ratio of women \ncandidates, with close to 20% of the workforce consisting of women \n(excluding the board industry, which has a relatively larger proportion \nof men to women).\nThe top 25 global semiconductor companies now have a presence in \nIndia through their captive centers, working in cutting edge technology \nnodes. Out of the total India engineering R&D spend of US$7.9 billion, \ninvestment in the semiconductor space is estimated at nearly 19% of \nthe total. The growth of the Indian semiconductor design industry has contributed \nto the employment of close to 1,35,000 employees in 2009.\nThe design industry also generates employment to support ancillary \nsemiconductor segments such as PCB design, packaging and testing.\nThe semiconductor design industry also impacts the lives of indirect \nemployees. The establishment of a semiconductor design unit provides \nemployment to numerous people involved in ancillary activities such as \ncatering, security, transportation and house-keeping.\n\n27 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nBilling models\nBilling models are undergoing changes with established standard models giving way to more \ncustomized ones in a dynamically growing industry. The various models being used include \nthe following:\n• Time and material model \nThis is the standard time-and-materials method of work, based on actuals.\n• A variant of this model is the time and material model with a “not-to-exceed clause” – \nthis is a standard time-and-materials method, with an additional clause that the price \npaid will not exceed a certain amount\n• Fixed price model \nThis model involves fixing the deliverable, project duration, platform, tools required for \ndesign and resources. Most of the time, the cost is decided by calculating the person-\nmonths required to execute the project, and any additional features requested during the \ncourse of the project are mutually agreed on by a change request.\n• Joint go-to-market models \nThere are two widely used models under this category, wherein captives involve third-\nparty service providers and Indian design companies at the following phases:\n• The design phase wherein service providers invest in the design phase and are paid \nfor it in the form of royalty from the end sales of the product\n• Sales phase, in addition to the design phase, through three channels – sell-to, sell-\nthrough and sell-with\nIndian semiconductor design industry drivers and \nchallenges\nDrivers\ni. Availability of talent pool \nWith the Indian Government focusing on improving access to higher education and the \nincreasing number of colleges and universities in the country, India adds a significantly \nlarge number of engineers to the talent pool every year.\nii. Maturity of the semiconductor industry \nWith their having gained considerable experience, Indian semiconductor design \ncompanies are seeing an increasing number of projects in chip development as compared \nto derivative chip design earlier. The complexity of work is also increasing with more \ndesigns being worked on for the current technology node.\niii. Cost competitiveness \nAlthough cost structures are gradually increasing in India on an absolute level, India \nstill has a considerably significant overall cost advantage as compared to the US, \nEurope or Japan. \n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry28\niv. Stringent IP protection measures \nThe Government of India and Indian design companies have strict policies on IP \nprotection as compared to other competing Asian countries. There have been instances \nwhen companies have sent work to India, even though design turnaround times are \nconsiderably higher in the country, as compared to the countries mentioned above, \nbecause of the more stringent IP protection measures in India.\nv. Proximity to growing APAC customers \nSemiconductor design companies in India are getting an increased amount of design \nwork due to the fact that the country is closer in terms of distance and time zone \ndifference for Asia-Pacific customers. \nvi. Reverse brain drain \nRepats, as they are known, are drawn by India’s booming economic growth, the chance \nto wrestle with complex problems and the opportunity to learn more about their heritage. \nThey are joining multinational companies or investing in start-ups, which augurs well \nfor the industry. This trend has not only raised the technological sophistication of VLSI \ndesign services, but has also assured the industry of abundant outsourcing projects.\nChallenges\ni. Lack of semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem\n• The lack of foundries implies insufficient experience in foundry interactions and a \nlonger time-to-market, which has inhibited the growth of the domestic semiconductor \ndesign industry to a certain extent. Unless this gap is plugged, the ecosystem cannot \nmature or develop at a rapid pace.\n• The lack of local ODM/ OEM companies that cater to the huge demand generated in \nthe country has hindered the rapid growth of the Indian ecosystem.\nii. People-related challenges\na. Quality of talent\n• Fresh talent supply: The difference in expectations between the industry and the \nIndian education system results in low skill-sets in the talent pool graduating from \nnon-premier institutes. This implies higher training costs and a considerably large \ngestation period before an engineer is productive.\n• Lack of experience: Companies have cited instances of lack of experienced talent \nin terms of breadth and depth of experience — breadth indicates knowledge of \nall the aspects of design flow and depth an extensive knowledge of a particular \naspect of the design flow.\n• Digital vs. analog: Although India has strong capabilities in digital technologies, it \nlacks the requisite number of engineering graduates who are capable of handling \nanalog technologies.\n• Lack of product know-how: There is a lack of talent for product conceptualization \nand management for emerging markets. Systems management for captives \ncontinues to be driven by the headquarters of companies — qualified and \nexperienced talent need to be nurtured to fill this gap. \n\n29 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nb. Lack of awareness of technical career path \nThe workforce in India values management leadership as compared to technical \nleadership, unlike in the Silicon Valley region. This is aggravated by substantial salary \ndifferences between technical and management personnel with the same work \nexperience. In the Silicon Valley, technically inclined people are promoted to the \nposition of a fellow, which is the equivalent of a Vice-President and salary differences \nare not significant.\nc. Attrition \nGiven that the current workforce in the semiconductor design industry in India is \nquite small, attrition due to competitive pressures on people or their moving on for \nhigher studies can adversely impact the design ecosystem.\nAnother reason for high attrition can be attributed to high recruitment by large third-\nparty service providers, who were traditionally in the enterprise application space, \nbut are now forming large teams to tap the next growth area in VLSI and embedded \ndesign.\niii. Competition from China, Taiwan and other South East Asian countries \nThe countries mentioned above have had a complete and mature ecosystem, which \nhas been built over the past 30 years, with the presence of OEM/ODM players, strong \ngovernment support, infrastructure, uninterrupted power. Therefore, these countries are \noften preferred over India, even in the areas of design-related activities.\niv. Eroding cost advantage \nBoth the captives and the non-captives face this challenge in terms of rapidly increasing \ncost structures and the pressure on billing rates, which lead to the loss of competitive \nadvantage as compared to other low-cost Asian or eastern European countries.\nv. Adoption of protectionist policies by other countries \nThe rising insecurity of foreign governments and companies in offshoring activities to \nIndia (or other offshore destinations) could become a challenge to attract more work to \nIndia, going forward.\nInnovation landscape in India\nRecessionary impact on Innovation in India\nRecession did not mean a major setback for India with regard to filing of patents. Statistics \nindicate a minor decrease in filing and grants of patents during the period of the economic \ndownturn. It is important to know that many commercially successful innovations were made \nduring this period. Many semiconductor companies undertook IP audits to take stock of their \nIP portfolios and determine alternative paths of funding during the crisis, e.g., licensing, \nfranchising, etc. Of the companies interviewed, many indicated that recession was a good \ntime to invest in R&D, so that they were in a better position when the economy improved.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry30\nMeasurement of innovation\nNo country currently includes a comprehensive estimate of business investment in intangible \nassets in their official accounts. Most economists agree, however, that intangible assets — \nwhich represent an important input in the innovative process—are critical components of a \nmodern economy. \nAmong tangible assets, several quantitative measures pertaining to innovation are possible, \nincluding patents, trademarks and designs. A review of such measures leads to the \nconclusion that each of these has some validity, but none can act as a stand-alone measure \nof innovation. This is the reason why such measures are called “indicators.” Such indicators \ncan be combined to form an overall measure of innovation. This section attempts to study \nsome of the following indictors of innovation activity in India:\n• Research labs\n• IEEE papers\n• Venture capital activity\nResearch labs\nMost of the R&D labs present in India, which are concentrated on the semiconductor domain, \nare located in premier technical institutes in the country. These institutes have access to \nfunding, experienced faculty, infrastructure as well as the availability of a large talent pool.\nAccording to the ISA-Evalueserve study 2008, 70–75% of semiconductor research activities \nare concentrated in the IITs, IISc and in BITS, Pilani.\nResearch fields\nIn view of research activity that is proportionate to the percentage breakup of faculty \nmembers in the field, almost 43% of research activities undertaken in Indian institutes are in \nthe area of chip design. \nExhibit 13: Breakup of research related activities in Indian institutes\n33.20%\n17.10%16.10%\n12.50%\n9.90% 9.50%\n1.60%\nChip design Embedded \nsystemsProcess related EDA MEMS and \nsensorsTesting and \nvalidationOthers\nSource: ISA-Evalueserve Study 2008\n\n31 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nNearly 78% of the projects are related to chip design and 22% are in the fields of testing \nand verification. Around 47% of the projects are in the areas of analog and mixed signals. \nFabrication facilities that are not available in India are seen as a challenge for research, and \ndesigns have to be sent abroad to be tested. This results in delay in time and increases the \ncost of research.\nThe embedded segment forms the second-largest field of research in Indian institutes. \nResearch is conducted across the areas of control application, sensor network, FPGA, \nmemory and wireless.Exhibit 14: Percentage breakup of projects in chip design and testing\nSource: ISA-Evalueserve Study 2008Analog\n47%\nTesting and \nveriﬁcation\n22%Digital\n12%FPGA\n10%Memory design\n4%Others\n5%\nExhibit 15: Percentage breakup of projects in embedded systems\nSource: ISA-Evalueserve Study 2008Control application\n15%\nDigital signal \nprocessing\n10%\nSensor network\n8%\nFPGA\n12%Memory\n8%Wireless\n10%Others\n37%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry32\nResearch in EDA is limited to optimization techniques, algorithms, simulators and simple \ndesign tools.\nResearch output\nOf the IEEE papers published between 2003 and 2007, Indian institutes show maximum \nactivity in terms of publishing research papers due to the greater importance given to \nknowledge sharing in these institutes. Papers that are published may not have commercial \nviability, resulting in a low percentage of publications from the industry. Among the papers \npublished by the institutes, almost half are in the process/manufacturing segment, followed \nby chip design and embedded software.Exhibit 16: Percentage breakup of projects in EDA\nSource: ISA-Evalueserve Study 2008Algorithm\n29%\nModeling\n16% Simulators\n21%Tool design\n29%Others\n5%\nExhibit 17: Research output\nSource: ISA-Evalueserve Study 2008Industry \nplayers, \n11%Government \nbodies, 7%Others, \n6% Process \nrelated,\n47%Chip design \nand testing, \n26%\nEmbedd \nsystems, 13%MEMS and \nsensors, 5%EDA, 4%Others, 5%Indian \ninstitutes, \n76%\n\n33 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nIndustry–academia tie-ups\nIn India, industry plays a key role in promoting research-related activities. Various forums of \nindustry-academia tie-ups exist such as the following:\n• Consultancy — The faculty at institutes work as consultants on industry projects. \n• Research-based industrial consultancy: The faculty conducts research at \nthese institutes.\n• ► On-site industrial consultancy: The faculty conducts research at the facility provided \nby industry.\n• One-on-one – These are tie-ups between academic institutes and industry players, \nresulting in focused and customized research.\n• Consortium – This is a tie-up between an academic institute and multiple industry \nplayers. Funding is provided by all the players to enable the institute to conduct research \non specific topics. \n• Collaboration with overseas institutes – Indian institutes working in collaboration with \noverseas universities in the more developed countries provide the latter access to the \nlatest technologies and sharing of knowledge.\nIEEE papers\nIEEE papers submitted, 2005-2009\nThe number of IEEE papers submitted in India has shown a growing trend as compared to \nother countries such as China. The number of papers submitted from India has grown from \n57 in 2005 to 95 in 2009, garnering 6% of global submission of IEEE papers.\nAlthough the figures above indicate submission of IEEE papers, the overall number of papers \npublished in India in 2010 is quite low with an acceptance ratio of only 4.48%, as compared \nto acceptance rates in the US and the UK, which had acceptance rates of at 38% and 34%, \nrespectively and 15%, for China. This reveals a relative lack of quality in research work \ncarried out in India.Exhibit 18: IEEE papers submitted, 2005-2009\nSource: IEEE578495\n4.9%5.5%6.0%\n0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7%\n0102030405060708090100\n2005 2007 2009Percentage of world submissionsNo. of IEEE papers submited\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry34\nStatistics on IEEE papers are sourced from the IEEE societies of computer, software, design \nand testing of computers, transaction on computers and software engineering.\nVenture capital activity\nAlthough venture capital (VC) companies are keen on investing in the Indian semiconductor \ndesign industry, currently, there is very little activity seen by these players. The focus of VCs \non India is more on IT/ITeS service companies. \nStartups in the design industry are very small players, which do not grow in scale quickly, \ndue to the nature of the industry, which is quite unlike the trend seen in the IT/ITeS industry. \nHence, these startups are mainly funded by Angel funds, which are difficult to track.\nThe other reasons why VCs may be staying away from the Indian semiconductor industry can \nalso be the absence of semiconductor-manufacturing units in the country, the volatile cyclical \nnature of the industry and the difficulty in getting valuations for design companies.\nIndia: talent analysis\nInstalled talent pool\nThe strong growth in the Indian semiconductor design industry has resulted in employment \nopportunities for the engineering workforce in the respective segments. The current \nworkforce in the semiconductor design industry in India was estimated at around 135,000 in \n2009 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% to reach \n230,000 by 2012.\nExhibit 19: Installed talent pool, 2009-2012 (in ‘000s)\nSource: ISA135 160 192 234 \n050100150200250\n2009 2010 2011 201220%\n\n35 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nBreakup by educational qualifications\nThe semiconductor design industry is dominated by engineering graduates, who comprise \ntwo-thirds of the entire workforce, followed by Master’s degree holders. The industry cites \nsix months to a year for talent graduating from colleges to become deployable and industry-\nready. The diploma holders are mainly recruited in the board segment.\nExperience-wise and diversity ratio distribution of employees \nThe semiconductor design industry consists mainly of a young workforce, with close to 60% \nwith experience of one to eight years. The industry in India primarily constitutes men, with \nwomen comprising 20% of the workforce. The VLSI and embedded segments comprise of a \nhigh ratio of women as compared to the board segment.Exhibit 20: Semiconductor design industry split by educational \nqualiﬁcation, 2009\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010Bachelors in \ntechnology\n77.6%Masters degree\n19.1%Ph.D\n1.0%Diploma holders\n1.2% Others\n1.1%\nExhibit 21: Semiconductor design \nindustry headcount split by \nexperience, 2009\nSource: ISA<1 year\n14%\n1 -3 years\n20%\n3 -8 years\n37%>8 years\n29%\nMale\n80%Female\n20%Exhibit 22: Semiconductor design \nindustry split by gender, 2009\nSource: ISA\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry36\nSpecial Manpower Development Programme – Phase II\nDuring the Ninth Plan, the Department \nof Information Technology (DIT) aimed \nto increase India’s share of the global \nVLSI design market from around 0.5% to \naround 5.0%. In view of the availability of \nquality human resources for achieving this \ntarget as the key catalyst, The DIT initiated \na “Special Manpower Development \nProgramme in the area of VLSI Design and \nrelated Software,” which comprised 19 \ninstitutions (7 resource centers (RCs) and \n12 participating institutions (PIs) in 1998.\nThe objective of this program was to \ncarry out research and guidance in VLSI-\nrelated areas with the establishment of \nVLSI Design Labs at resource centers \nand participating institutions by training \ngraduates, post graduates and at the \ndoctoral level.SMDP II, which started in the year 2006, is \ncurrently present across the country and \nof 32 institutions, consisting of 7 resource \ncenters and 25 participating institutes, \nparticipate in it.\nThe talent pool generated from SMDP II of \nDIT, in terms of the number of students for \nthe academic year 2009–2010, according \nto our estimates from discussions with \nresource centers and participating \ninstitutes, is a total of 5471. The individual \nbreakup comprises:\n• ► Type I – 58\n• ► Type II – 672\n• ► Type III – 892\n• ► Type IV - 3849\nFresh graduate talent supply\nEngineering is the preferred educational stream for Indian youth, as a result of which India \nproduces around 361,000 engineering graduates every year. This includes graduates as well \nas post graduate degree holders. \n• Relevant engineering talent for the semiconductor design industry: \n• Computer science\n• Software\n• Electronics and communications\n• Electrical and electronics\n• Information Technology (IT)\nIndia produced around 222,000 fresh engineering graduates in these streams, comprising \nnearly 62% of the total engineering turnout, in 2009.\nExhibit 23 showcases the growth of fresh engineering talent over five years.\n\n37 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nThe fresh graduating population relevant for the semiconductor design industry is set to \ngrow at a CAGR of around 11% to more than 300,000 by 2013. This growth is expected as a \nresult of the following policies and measures implemented the Indian Government. \nGrants program: To motivate students to opt for higher education at the doctorate level, \nthe Government has launched a couple of grants programs. UGC selects 50 candidates each \nyear for Junior Research Fellowships. \nInclusion program: To promote technical education for women, handicapped and the weaker \nsections of the society, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has introduced \nits Tuition Waiver Scheme for women, economically backward and physically handicapped \nmeritorious students in technical institutions.\nImprovement in quality of education: The percentage of fresh talent from tier 1 institutes \nsuch as the IITs and the NITs is geared to increase due to the proposed increase in the \nnumber of these institutes. Hence, the quality of talent available that is to be deployed in the \nsemiconductor design industry is also set to improve.Exhibit 23: Fresh graduate supply in India\nSource: NASSCOM Strategic Review, 2010, EY research328361401444493\n201222247274305\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Fresh graduate talent (in '000)\nTotal engineering talent Relevant engineering talent11%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry38\nSplit of talent supply by type of degree\nThe type of degree (B.Tech or M.Tech) is an important parameter to determine the proportion \nof specialized talent available.

Institutes such as the IITs and NITs have tough entry criteria, excellent \nfaculty and renowned alumni. Around 6% (approx. 13,000) of the graduates, who may be \nrelevant for the semiconductor design industry, graduate from tier 1 institutes such as the \nIITs and NITs. \nLocation split of universities offering relevant degrees\nThe location split of engineering colleges and universities is an important parameter to \ndefine the catchment area of relevant talent for semiconductor companies.\nIndia can be divided into five geographical regions — northern, eastern, western, southern \nand central. The split of states is as follows: Exhibit 27: Split of fresh talent by university tier (percentage split of the \nrelevant talent pool), 2010\nSource: HRD Ministry’s Annual Report 2009-2010, Admission boards of IITs and NITsIIT, 3%NIT, 3%\nOthers, 94%\nRegion States\nNorthern Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, \nBihar, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh\nEastern Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura, Jharkhand, \nNagaland, Orissa and West Bengal\nWestern Maharasthra and Goa\nSouthern Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu\nCentral Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh\nSource: AICTE Exhibit 28: Location split of universities offering relevant degrees\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry40\nMost of the universities are based in the southern region.

Around 18% of fresh \nengineering graduates in 2009–10 were women. However, the Government has put several \nprograms in place to ensure inclusion of women. \n• Around 85% of the target beneficiaries of the SAAKSHAR BHARAT (the national literacy \nmission) will be women.\n• Mahila Samakhya is an ongoing scheme for education and empowerment of women in \nrural areas.Exhibit 30: Gender ratio of fresh talent supply (% split of the relevant \ntalent pool), 2010\nSource: HRD Ministry’s Annual Report 2009-2010Male graduates, \n82%Female \ngraduates, \n18%Exhibit 29: Geographic split of universities offering relevant degrees, 2010\nSource: AICTE295213635997\n2842424\nCentral Eastern Northern Southern Western Total\nNumber of engineering institutes\n\n41 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nIndia’s talent analysis summary\nThe current workforce in the semiconductor design industry in India was estimated at around \n135,000 in 2009 and is expected to grow at 20% to reach 230,000 by 2012. Around 70% of \nthe installed workforce has experience of more than three years. Women constitute around \n22% of this workforce, with a the majority of them working in the VLSI and embedded \nsegments.\n• India produces around 222,000 fresh engineering graduates every year and this is \nexpected to grow at the rate of 11% over the next two to three years. The majority of \nthese students come from the southern part of the country, since the south Indian states \n(Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala) have the maximum density of \nengineering colleges. \n• This pool of engineers consists of 8% (around 18,000) post graduates. \n• Around 6% of graduates, who are relevant to the semiconductor industry, come from tier \n1 institutes such as the IITs and NITs. \n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry42\nVLSI design industry\nVLSI design is the process of designing integrated circuits by combining thousands of \ntransistors into a single chip, and involves various design activities ranging from specification \nto tape-out of the chip, as described in the next section.\nThe total revenue from VLSI design in India was estimated at US$ 826.7 million in 2009 and \nis expected to log a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% over the next three years. \nThe blended and fully-loaded cost per Full Time Employee (FTE) per month is close to US$ \n4,300 currently and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.7% over the next three years to reach \nUS$ 4700 in 2012. This increase in costs balances the increasing wage inflation and facility \ncosts with scale benefits.\nThese rates saw a bit of correction to 2007 rates due to the impact of the recession. One \nway in which the recession was managed was to change the skill-set mix by increasing the \nnumber of “freshers” to the lateral hiring ratio to lower average fully-loaded costs. \nVLSI still commands premium rates over the board and embedded segments, mainly due to \nthe complexity of the work involved and market competition for available talent.IV.\nExhibit 31: VLSI Design Industry in India by Revenue, 2009-12\nSource: ISA8279441,1081,333\n2009 2010 2011 2012USD millions17.3%\nExhibit 32: VLSI design industry in India — average blended and \nfully-loaded cost per FTE per month, 2009-12\nSource: ISA\nUSD millions2.7%\n4,3274,4574,5914,683\n2009 2010 2011 2012\n\n43 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nVLSI design flow/value chain\nMost of the VLSI design business in India originates from the United States with European \ncompanies contributing in the next place. Although Japan is home to a very large number \nof electronic product companies requiring design services, various challenges such as \nlanguage, culture, etc., have hindered VLSI requests for design business from Japan. Of late, \nmany companies are targeting Japan, and it is widely expected to become a major revenue \nsource in the future.\nEnd-to-end product ownership seldom occurs in India, since it is solely a function of being \nproximal to the customer, although we are beginning to see a change in this, with captives \nas well as some third-party service providers building capability to provide services in the \nentire value chain. Since India currently does not play host to customers of semiconductor \ncompanies (OEMs, ODMs, etc.), higher end activities in the design flow, such as specification \ndefinition and architecture design, are restricted to the global or regional head quarters of \ncompanies, which directly interact with their customers.\nAdditionally, another reason why total product ownership does not occur in India is that \nmost global semiconductor companies follow a distributed and collaborative development \nmethodology across various countries in multiple geographies. Hence, no single center has \ntotal ownership of a product or product-related decisions.\nIn the case of third-party service providers, captives are comfortable outsourcing total \ndesign -related activities from RTL coding or verification to tape-out for derivative products, \nbut have restricted design outsourcing of current generation products to lower complexity \nactivities in the design flow.\nRecessionary impact on VLSI design industry in India\nOf the companies interviewed, several indicated that the economic downturn of 2008–2009 \nhad not had a major impact on the VLSI design industry in India. During this time, the \nmajority of global semiconductor companies stalled their new products and aggressively \nfocused on derivative product development and design, which resulted in the offshore Indian \ncaptive centers of these semiconductor companies getting additional work. Exhibit 33: Activities in the VLSI design ﬂow\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010Architecture RTL coding RTL veriﬁcation\nTape–out Back–end Synthesis To foundry\nDesign related activity Non–design related activitySpeciﬁcation\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry44\nThird-party service providers also indicated that they had been relatively immune to the \nrecession due to two major reasons:\n• Since most of the product development was on derivative chips, they were able to secure \na significant number of customer wins.\n• The recession also led them to explore alternative local revenue streams, which opened \nup new markets such as defense and avionics in India.\nHowever, there is an overall semiconductor design industry consensus that the impact of \nthe recession was felt in India with growth getting delayed, increased cost pressures, a \nsignificant number of programs getting canceled, an increased percentage of employees \non the bench and potential hiring plans put on hold. Furthermore, the industry indicated \nthat the positive outlook provided in interviews was due to hindsight while looking at the \nrecession and the sharp slap-back effect with which the recession bounced back. \nEvery recession brings in its wake higher quality of work, and this one also forced third-party \nservice providers to look at new business models, which complimented their current service \nportfolios with IP- based solutions or a reusable framework for better revenue realization.\nKey consuming industry segments for VLSI design\nWith the increasing global demand for communications and consumer products, consumer \nelectronics products consist of the bulk of the VLSI design industry pie. Although the PC \nmarket is still the largest for chips, the demand for mobile phones and digital TVs is expected \nto spur the design industry again as the economy has begun to recover. New drivers of \ngrowth, such as increasing digitization of products and anytime/anywhere connectivity, have \ncaused vendors to expand the application of existing products to alternative end markets and \ndevelop new applications for biometric security markets, digital power supplies and gaming \ndevices. \nThe telecom sector is expected to continue its dominance as compared to 2007 levels, \nalthough it is expected to hit a plateau in terms of growth. The portable/wireless industry is \nalso driving growth with applications in connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, \nGPS, UWB, WiMax, NFC and the automobile electronics and healthcare segments expected to \nsee a small amount of traction. \n\n45 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \n Exhibit 34: VLSI design projects split by consuming industry segment, 200 –2011\n2009 2010 2011\nTelecom/Networking \nproducts31% 30.40% 30.00%\nIndustrial/Power electronics \nproducts4.50% 4.00% 3.80%\nPortable/Wireless products 14.80% 15.20% 15.40%\nConsumer electronics \nproducts34.50% 34.80% 35.00%\nAutomobile products 4.30% 4.50% 5.00%\nHealthcare 3.90% 4.00% 4.00%\nStorage 4.40% 4.50% 4.20%\nOthers 2.60% 2.60% 2.60%\nSource: ISA\nIndian VLSI design industry operations – quantitative \nanalysis\nDistribution of total projects carried out in India by gate count \n(complexity)\nThe industry continues to see large traction with almost 50% of its projects in the 1M–10M \ngate range, although with technology nodes moving to 65nm and below range, there is \nincreased activity in projects in the 10M–20M gate range. As the number of gate counts \nare increasing and technology nodes are moving into lower sub-micron ranges, various \nchallenges are beginning to surface, some of these including the quantum-mechanics \nphenomenon, thinner wires offering larger resistance, parasitics such as capacitive and \ninductive coupling between parallel wires and electro-migration.\nExhibit 35: VLSI design industry split of projects by gate count, 2009\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010Upto 1M\n14.0%\n1M -10M\n47.0%10M -20M\n31.0%20M -30M\n5.0%30M -50M\n2.0%>50M\n1.0%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry46\nDistribution of total projects carried out in India by technology\nAlthough the digital design industry still garners the majority of projects in India, the \nmixed signal design industry is showing significant momentum and is on an upward curve. \nDigital signal designs are more standardized, use simplified device models, work with \neasily available EDA tools and there is an abundant supply of talent in India. However, the \npercentage of work carried out in the analog industry is expected to remain constant due to \nthe dominance of eastern European countries in the industry. Other reasons for this include \nthe need for customizable synthesis tools, difficulty in testing designs and shortage of talent \ndue to lack of training focus and the need for specialized analog lab infrastructure, resulting \nin competition for already available talent.\nDistribution of total projects carried out in India by type of design\nAs the industry is maturing, companies have confidently begun developing their IP and \ninvesting in it. This is in line with the trend of captives partnering with third-party service \nproviders by participating in early chip development programs and providing modular IPs \nto reduce their time-to-market. The share of projects in the module design and verification \nspace has gradually declined over the last two years.

VLSI design requires specialized skill-sets, and hence, the presence of \na large number of postgraduates, as compared to the other two segments, particularly the \nboard/hardware segment.Exhibit 38: VLSI design industry workforce in India, 2009-12 (in ‘00s)\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010141172206252\n2009 2010 2011 201220%\nExhibit 39: VLSI design industry split by educational qualiﬁcation, 2009\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010Bachelors in \ntechnology\n73%\nMasters degree\n22%\nDiploma holders\n3%Ph.D\n2%Others\n1%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry48\nExperience-wise and diversity ratio distribution of employees \nThe distribution of the workforce is rather skewed toward more experience, mainly due to the \npresence of an older and mature VLSI industry workforce in India and a substantial number \nof VLSI designers, who are returning to India from abroad to join captives or service provider \nfirms. Employees with more than three years of work experience account for close to 60% of \nthe entire workforce in the country. Although the VLSI industry largely comprises men, the \npercentage of women in this sector has grown slightly year-on-year.\nDistribution of employees by technology\nWhile digital technology attracts an abundance of talent to the Indian VLSI industry, \ncompanies are moving up the value chain, which is evident in increased availability of talent \nin the analog and mixed signals space. Analog designs are becoming more intuitive and \ncome with quite a few years of experience. These designs cannot be automated as easily \nas digital signals, making tools of little or no use. The crucial point is the requirement for \nspecific analog-related skill-sets, which are still scarce, and the availability of talent does \nnot meet the requirements. On the other hand, data converters and wireless networks are \ndriving the demand for mixed signal engineers.

Increasing maturity of the Indian design ecosystem \nWith the presence of the top 25 semiconductor companies and 10 fab-less companies in \nIndia, more complex work, in terms of current technology nodes, is being carried out in \nIndian centers.\nCompanies that have been in existence for more than 10 years in the country are slowly \nmoving toward complete engineering ownership (including end-customer support), which \nhas been one the key factors driving maturity in the VLSI segmentExhibit 43: Increasing demand for electronic products globally, \nUSD billions, 2009-2020\nSource: EY report on electronics systems design and manufacturing ecosystem, 20092.9%USD millions\n1,750 2,000 2,400 \n2009 2014 2020\nGlobal industry size\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry50\nChallenges\nThough there are signs that indicate a positive outlook for the VLSI design industry in \nIndia, there a few challenges which hinder its progress, among which a few need to be \naddressed soon.\ni. Lack of scale at leading node \nWith technology transforming at a rapid pace (Moore’s Law), India’s deficit of relevant \ntalent is increasing. Although expertise does exist in handling geometries of 45nm \nor 32nm, there is an absence of scale, with most of the engineers in India handling \ngeometries of 65nm and 90nm. Design and validation of complex system on chips (SoCs) \nand getting the silicon to work the first time is the biggest challenge. Furthermore, \nverification or validation of such complex systems is one of the biggest challenges, which \nrequires the use of methodologies such as OVM, VMM and UVM.\nii. Lack of R&D funding in universities\nUniversities in mature markets such as in the US or in Europe work on cutting edge \nchip technologies and design, which materialize into products a few years later. But this \nphenomenon is absent in India, which leads to fresh talent not being readily deployable \nand requiring a lead time to come to speed. Challenges present themselves in inadequate \nresearch infrastructure facilities to facilitate research toward device shrinkage beyond \n45/32nm semiconductor process technology.\n\n51 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nEmbedded software industry\nEmbedded software is any computer software which plays an integral role in the electronics \nwith which it is supplied. It can be any code, which interacts with the hardware layer, \nranging from the hardware abstraction layer, device drivers, kernel programming to \napplication programming.\nThe total embedded software industry in India was estimated at US$ 5.3 billion in 2009 \nand is projected to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% to reach US$8.6 billion in 2012. This industry \naccounts for the bulk of semiconductor design activities in India, with a share of 80% in the \nIndian semiconductor design industry’s revenues. \nThe industry estimate of the fully-loaded cost per FTE per month is US$ 3,656 and is \nexpected to rise at a CAGR of 2.7% to reach close to US$ 4,000 in 2012. This growth can \nbe attributed to the embedded software industry tiding over the recession and third-party \nservice providers recruiting in bulk.V.\nExhibit 44: Embedded software industry in India by revenues, 2009-12\nSource: ISA17.3%\n5317607671278579\n02,0004,0006,0008,00010,000\n2009 2010 2011 2012USD millions\nExhibit 45: Embedded software design industry in india – average blended \nand fully-loaded cost per FTE per month, 2009-12\nSource: ISA3656376638793956\n3,5003,5503,6003,6503,7003,7503,8003,8503,9003,9504,000\n2009 2010 2011 2012USD \n2.7%\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry52\nEmbedded software layer\nWhile in terms of amount of labor, more embedded software programmers are required for \nmovement away from the hardware abstraction layer to the application layer, in terms of \ncomplexity, multiple skill-sets are required on movement from the application layer to the \nhardware abstraction layer.\nThe embedded software industry is expanding as third-party service providers are moving up \nthe value chain to offer more high-value activities relating to middleware, driver design and \nassociated applications.\nCaptives largely work on the hardware abstraction layer and the device driver layer. While \nmany captives outsource application-related work to third-party service providers and Indian \ndesign companies to shorten their time-to-market, others prefer to grow their domain-\nspecific embedded application expertise in-house.\nOther reasons for increased adoption of embedded software is its utilization by electronic \ncompanies in the face of immense pressure for innovation from end customers in terms of \nincreased functionality, reduced time-to-market and reduction in costs.

Product customization due to localization \nThe growing consumer market is creating a need for localized product features, resulting \nin increasing activity in the embedded software development domain, especially in the \nconsumer electronics, defense, telecom and automotives segments.\nii. Greater requirement for flexibility and functionality \nGrowing affluence is redefining lifestyle aspirations, influenced by growing self-\nconfidence, expanding consumerism, increased spending power and greater access to \nlifestyle goods and services, e.g., in the field of automobiles, embedded software being \nused in features such as power steering and windows. \niii. Legislative requirements \nCountry specific legislations, such as Bharat Stage -IV norms, require customization of \ncertain features/functionality. Other instances are in the field of green energy (emission \ncontrol), safety innovations (anti-lock brakes and air bags), etc.\niv. Increasing capability of third-party service providers and Indian design companies \nThe increasing capability of third-party service providers and Indian design companies, \nwhich are moving up the value chain to offer high-value activities relating to middleware \nand OS programming, is driving the expansion of the embedded software industry in \nIndia.\nv. Lower entry barrier for service providers \nEmbedded software development does not require costly tools and solutions such as \nEDA, and the presence of a large talent pool has resulted in the establishment of a large \nnumber of small and niche service providers in this space.\nvi. Adaption of open-source platforms \nWith chip design companies adapting open-source platforms such as Linux and Google’s \nAndroid, there is an increased amount of embedded software required to support a chip’s \nfunctionality, in which has given a boost to the embedded software industry\n\n57 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nChallenges\ni. Cost pressures due to constantly evolving platforms \nOne of the key challenges in the embedded software industry is to keep pace with the \ncurrent technology node, which changes every 18–24 months, while providing increased \nfunctionality at the same or lower cost.\nii. Integration and testing of software and hardware \nSemiconductor design companies face issues relating to integration and testing of \nsoftware procured from IP providers. Although many captives have invested in home-\ngrown integration and testing platforms or frameworks, this increases cost pressures \non IP developers and causes performance issues with the integration of multiple IPs. No \nstandard methodology is evolving, even with the use of various traditional methods such \nas co-simulation, simulation acceleration, emulation, and FPGA testing.\niii. Skill-set availability of high-end programmers \nMultiple embedded processors in SoCs / MCUs with independent functions are being \nadopted in electronic devices due to higher power consumption from single core \nprocessors. Building these reliable and high-performance systems requires parallel \nsoftware development, called symmetric multi processing, which is leading to an \nincreased requirement of expert parallel programmers. There are also challenges in \nfinding software programmers, who can balance power and tight optimization in limited \nhardware memory.\niv. Preference for ADM services as a career option \nIn terms of complexity, embedded programmers have to work within a limited \nmemory that comes with the hardware, balance power, cost, size and simplicity of the \ndesign. However, even in the case of those with these complex skill-sets, Application, \nDevelopment and Maintenance (ADM) services are perceived as an uncomplicated \ncareer option.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry58\nThe hardware/board design Industry in India was estimated at around US $ 417 million in \n2009 and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 17.3% to reach US$ 672 million in 2012. This \nindustry is the smallest segment in the Indian semiconductor design industry, accounting \nfor only 6.3% of the design industry’s revenues. Its growth can be attributed to captives \nconcentrating on pure-play VLSI activities and preferring to outsource reference and new \nboard design activities to third-party service providers and to set up home-grown companies \nthat only concentrate on board/hardware design activities.\nThe industry estimate for the average fully loaded cost per FTE per month is US$ 3,240 \nand is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.7% to reach US$ 3,506 in 2012. These rates are \ncomparatively lower than that commanded by the embedded software industry and \nconsiderably lower than the VLSI design industry’s. One reason could be the presence of a \nlarger percentage of diploma holders in the industry, as is seen later in Exhibit 78, which \nhelps to bring down the average fully-loaded cost per FTE.Board/hardware design industryVI.\n672Exhibit 53: Hardware/board design industry in India by revenues, 2009-12\nSource: ISA417476558\n0100200300400500600700800\n2009 2010 2011 2012USD millions17.3% \nExhibit 54: Hardware/board design industry – average blended and \nfully-loaded cost per FTE per month, 2009–2012\nSource: ISA2.7%\n3240333734373506\n3,1003,1503,2003,2503,3003,3503,4003,4503,5003,550\n2009 2010 2011 2012US D\n\n59 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nThis segment broadly consists of the following categories:\n• Reference board design\n• New board design\n• Board design derivatives and modifications on existing boards\nMost captives only make reference boards that are used to validate the capabilities of \nsilicon chips designed in-house. Captives are not yet providing reference board designs as a \nservice to other companies. Some captives are outsourcing reference board design work to \nthird-party service providers and Indian design companies, in which the schematic layout is \ndesigned by the captives and the rest of the activities are outsourced, which decreases the \ntime-to-market of the chip. These service providers have a significant presence in the new \nand derivative board design space for product development companies\nThere is significant opportunity for hardware/ board design services in India. Some of the \nfactors contributing to this include:\n• As compared to the VLSI segment, proximity to local/ end-use markets has a pronounced \neffect on hardware/ board design, since customer requirements and local nuances \nneed to be considered. With most global electronic product majors focusing on creating \nemerging market-specific products, this leads to significant traction in the segment\n• Indian service providers are taking strong IP measures to drive India’s USP, as compared \nto competition from countries such as China and Taiwan. Some of the measures \nundertaken include:\n• Conducting IP protection sessions regularly for all employees to reinforce IP \nprotection principles\n• Conducting IP audits for every project to ensure that no open source codecs or other \ncompanies code is used \n• Providing cool-off period for designers before they work on a competitor \ncustomer product\nHardware/board design flow\nIn terms of design-related activities, captives are collaborating with third-party service \nproviders during the chip design stage.

The development of such products requires diverse skill-\nsets spanning electronics and electrical engineering, computer science and programming, \nand advanced mathematics. India has traditionally been very attractive to global EDA for \nproduct development due to the country’s high graduate turnout in relevant fields. \nThere are an increasing number of companies operating in the semiconductor design space, \nboth captives and non-captives (including India-based semiconductor product companies). \nThese companies are moving up the value chain to take up higher complexity design work, \nwhich creates a huge demand for EDA tool usage.\nIt is quite impossible to estimate the revenues of individual countries, where a large number \nof captive centers are located, since license sale happens at their headquarters and these \nlicenses are utilized in unique ways across time zones to optimize costs.\nDrivers of the Indian EDA industry\ni. Rapidly evolving semiconductor design ecosystem in India \nCompanies operating in the semiconductor design space in India are moving up the value \nchain to take up higher complexity projects and are operating in an engineering product \nownership mode, which is resulting in increased design services being performed in India. \nThis is driving increased EDA tool license sales in India.\nii. Increasing design complexity \nDecreasing technology nodes and an increasing number of architectural decisions, driven \nby Indian design centers, are creating a strong need for the adoption of additional EDA \ntools, to keep up with the rapid pace of the semiconductor industry.\niii. Strategic acquisitions by Indian design services companies \nIndian design services companies have acquired captive design centers to enhance \ntheir design service offerings, which emphasizes their commitment to the Indian \nsemiconductor scenario and is an indication of the burgeoning growth of this industry in \nthe country, e.g.,, MindTree’s acquisition of TES PV. \nChallenges for the Indian EDA industry\nThe EDA companies operating in India do not face any India-specific challenges, since there \nare no India- specific EDA tools or chips designs. The majority of the challenges faced by \nEDA companies are technical, and are caused due to rapid advancement in chip and chip-\nmanufacturing technologies. The rapid innovation cycles of semiconductor companies \nforce EDA companies to develop new products to keep pace with market requirements, e.g., \nlow power (from the system level through physical layout), functional verification challenges \nand manufacturing variability (through the application of design-for-manufacturing \ntechniques to design).\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry68\nLicensing models \ni. Perpetual license model \nThis is the more traditional model, which is seldom used. The license, once procured \nfor this model, is typically effective for 99 years. Maintenance, which includes technical \nsupport, product updates, bug fixes, etc., is typically purchased separately on a year-on-\nyear basis and is typically around 10 –15% of the perpetual license cost. \nii. Term -based models \nTerm-based models allow the lease of the EDA tool license for a fixed duration (in weeks/\nmonths/ years) and typically includes maintenance. This is the model preferred by most \ncompanies engaging in semiconductor design in India as it offers flexibility on a client-\nto-client and a project-to-project basis. The annual pricing of a time-based license is \ngenerally around 20 –40% of the price of the perpetual license.\na. Captives \nThe captive centers of global companies typically use a global pool of licenses hosted \nin one or more locations, which can be accessed by their employees worldwide across \ntime zones. These allow the flexibility of one license being utilized by more than one \ndesigner in a complimentary time zone. Less than 5% of the captive centers have \nopted for a site-specific/ India-specific license. A global license typically costs more \nthan a site-specific one due to the flexibility it offers.\nDelivery model categorizationCloud-based licenses\n(expected future trend)Exhibit 66: The various licensing models for EDA tools, 2009\nSource: EY research\nGeographic categorization\nChronological categorization\nNot in use currentlyPerpetual \nlicenses\nGlobal license \npoolSite speciﬁc \nlicenseTerm-based \nlicenses\nGlobal license \npoolSite-speciﬁc \nlicenseEDA licensing \nmodels\n\n69 Section 1: \nIndustry analysis \nb. Third-party service providers \nIn the case of third-party service providers, who have fixed delivery centers \nacross the world, the site-specific license is the preferred model (c. 80–90%) over \na global one.\n However, utilization of the license depends on the customer’s budget and infrastructure. In the case \nof small customer budgets, service providers use their own licenses. In the case of a larger customer \nbudgets, third-party service providers typically use the customers’ licenses, either onsite or offsite for \nclient servicing.\niii. Cloud-based licenses \nNone of the companies currently offer this type of a delivery model, in which the purchaser is charged on a \npay-per-use basis. However, this is slated to be the a key trend in the industry as it opens up opportunities \nfor EDA tool vendors to tap into a larger section of the market, which cannot afford to pay huge upfront \nlicense costs.\nEDA tool-buying behavior\nThe purchase of an EDA tool depends on a multitude of factors including costs, capabilities, features, the \nmaturity of the team that will be using it, etc. Based on discussions with industry players, companies head- \nquartered in the Americas have typically preferred a global pool of licenses, as compared to companies in \nEurope that have site-specific license allocation for specific projects/ products.\nThe maturity and capability of the global design center of an MNC firm typically defines the types of EDA \ntools and license models. The head of a relatively mature design center (implying local engineering ownership \nand governance) has a significant say in purchase decisions related to that center, as compared to a newly \nestablished center, which is globally governed and monitored.\nCompanies with lower EDA budgets have limited themselves to a single EDA tool across their organizations, but \nthose with larger budgets typically use a diverse set of tools from multiple tool vendors for various applications \nin their global location.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry70\nAnnexure II: definitions\nCaptive unit \nA captive unit is a company that develops a \ntotal product or a module, which it brands \nand markets as part of its (own) product \ndevelopment.

The study explains various \nparameters that are important for the development of a country’s semiconductor design \nsector. Quantitative benchmarking for India has been done on these parameters vis-à-vis \nother countries, which are considered pioneers of semiconductor design.\nThe countries selected for this study constitute a representative sample of semiconductor \ndesign activity. India’s benchmarking has been done with the following countries:\n• ► The US\n• ► The UK\n• ► Germany\n• ► Sweden\n• ► China\n• ► Taiwan\n• ► Israel\nWe conducted the study through publicly available secondary sources. Other countries such \nas Japan and South Korea, which are considered pioneers in semiconductor design, were \nnot included in the sample set because of associated difficulties in obtaining information \nfrom public sources due to language constraints. The parameters for this study are industry \ndynamics, talent pool, innovation environment, operating costs, infrastructure and quality of \nthe business environment.\nThe section on industry dynamics consists of parameters that explain the development of the \nsemiconductor ecosystem in a country. It comprises a number of design houses, electronics \nproduction, design industry revenues and the geographic concentration or fragmentation of \nthe industry. \n\n77\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Semiconductor design requires a highly skilled labor force. The talent pool section focuses \non the number of engineers currently working in the semiconductor design sector and the \nannual addition of engineers qualified in disciplines relevant to the semiconductor design \nsector. The number of engineering colleges covered in this section is an indicator of the \nfuture scalability of talent.\nThe design sector involves a high degree of creation of IP. The innovation environment \ndeals with the innovation capabilities of a country as a whole. The comparison on innovation \nenvironment has been made based on the quality of scientific research institutes and \nspending on R&D by companies. Countries have also been benchmarked on the number of \nIEEE papers filed from the country for disciplines relevant for semiconductor industry.\nOperating cost is an important parameter, as it impacts the overall profitability of running \na business in a country. The major costs of operating in a country include manpower \ncost, office space rentals, electricity cost, interest cost and travel cost. High costs reduce \nprofitability and, therefore, companies do not consider countries with high operational costs \nto be favorable business destinations.\nThe quality of physical infrastructure available in a country is a major factor that attracts new \nplayers, both domestic and foreign, for business. The study focuses on comparing countries \non the basis of communication infrastructure, the availability of high-quality Grade A office \nspace and the power demand-supply scenario.\nThe section on the quality of business environment describes parameters that depict the \nease of doing business in a country. A country’s business environment is measured by \nthe complexity involved in starting a new business in terms of number of procedures and \ntaxation rates. Prevalence of an efficient legal framework is important for the protection \nof IP rights for that country’s semiconductor design industry. Efficiency of legal framework \nin challenging regulations has been used as benchmarking parameter to study the legal \nenvironment in a country.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry78\nQuantitative country \nbenchmarking II.\nExhibit 1\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Industry dynamics\nIndustry dynamics comprises factors that explain the semiconductor design ecosystem of a \nparticular country. These factors include semiconductor design industry revenues, quantum \nof electronics production, number of semiconductor design companies operating in the \ncountry, and geographical concentration or fragmentation of the industry. Such factors help \nexplain the maturity of a particular country’s semiconductor design industry. \nThe benchmarking parameters considered in this category are:\n• Industry revenues\n• Quantum of electronics production\n• Number of semiconductor design companies\n• Geographically concentrated/fragmented industry\nThe quantum of electronics production sheds some light on the maturity of the \nsemiconductor ecosystem, since the electronics sector is a major consumer of \nsemiconductors. So, an increase in electronics production will indicate a better market \npotential for the semiconductor industry.\nElectronics production data has been obtained from the OECD Information Technology \nOutlook: 2010 , an Organization for European Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) publication.Exhibit 2\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Industry revenues\nIndustry revenues reflect the level of semiconductor design activity taking place in a \nparticular country. The numbers for revenues have been estimated using the number of \ndesign engineers working in a particular country, fully loaded cost (including tools and \ninfrastructure) per full-time employee (FTE) and profit margin.\nExhibit 3 compares the countries on the value of semiconductor design industry revenues \nin 2009.\nKey observations\n• Among the sample set of countries, the US has the highest semiconductor design \nrevenues.\n• With design revenues of US$1.23 billion, Israel ranks last among the sample set of \ncountries. \n• India ranks second among the sample set of countries, with revenues of US$6.6 billion.\nTakeaways for India\n• Since the US leads the sample set in terms of number of design engineers and average \nsalary cost of an FTE, design revenues in the US are the highest. Benchmarking on the \nnumber of design engineers has been done in Chapter 2.a., while salary cost has been \nbenchmarked in Chapter 4.c.\n• Based on the steady increase in the number of design engineers in India in the past few \nyears, design revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% until 2012.Exhibit 3: Semiconductor design industry revenues\n*Data not available for GermanySource: Multiple; refer references on page 1240.002.004.006.008.0010.0012.00\n44.9\nUS UK Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaIndustry revenues (in US$ billion)\n\n81\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking 1.b. Quantum of electronics production\nSemiconductors constitute an integral part of electronic products. Therefore, a high amount \nof electronics production boosts growth in a country’s semiconductor industry.\nExhibit 4 compares countries on the value of electronics production in 2009. \nKey observations\n• China leads the sample set of countries in terms of value of electronics components and \nequipment manufactured with revenues of more than US$411.7 billion from electronics \nproduction.\n• Sweden has the lowest value of annual electronics production in the sample set, at \napproximately US$7.5 billion.\n• Electronics production in India was valued at US$20.3 billion in 2009, and ranks sixth \namong sample set countries on this parameter. \n• ► While India is ahead of Sweden and Israel, it lags behind China, the US, Germany, Taiwan \nand the UK.Exhibit 4: Quantum of electronics production\n0102030405060708090100\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaElectronics production (in US$ billion)411.7 240.4\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 124\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry82\nThe Indian electronics industry\nThe demand for electronics in the Indian market stood at US$45 billion in 2009 and is \nprojected to grow at a CAGR of 22% to reach US$125 billion by 2014 and to US$400 \nbillion by 2020. India meets a large portion of its domestic demand of electronics items \nthrough imports from countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea and Malaysia. Exports, which \nconstituted a small portion (approximately 21%) of production in 2009, are expected to \nincrease from US$4.4 billion in 2009 to US$15 billion by 2014 and US$80 billion by 2020, \ngrowing at a CAGR of approximately 31%.\nGrowth in per-capita income has been a major trend driving this market. Nearly 10 million \nhouseholds are estimated to have income levels above US$10,000 per annum. With an \nannual growth rate of 20%, this household segment offers opportunities for electronics \nproducts. The rising Indian middle class has generated more demand for mobile handsets, \ntelevisions, retail, and automotive and other consumer electronics products.\nElectronics production between 2005 and 2009 grew at a CAGR of approximately 17%. At \nthis rate, electronics production is expected to increase to US$114 billion in 2020. This, \nin turn, is likely to lead to a significant increase in the demand-supply gap, which will rise \nto US$286 billion in 2020. Therefore, it is essential to increase the pace of growth. The \ntargeted growth rate in electronics production is around 31% annually between 2009 and \n2020 and is expected to reach a value of US$400 billion. Of this, while US$80 billion is \nexpected to be exported, US$320 billion will meet domestic demand.\nTakeaways for India\n• The rapidly growing electronics market is likely to serve as an important growth driver for \nthe Indian semiconductor industry.\n• Despite the rising demand for electronics in India, certain challenges tend to lead to a \nsignificant demand-supply gap.\nExhibit 5: Factors resulting in relatively low electronics production\nHigh and unstable corporate tax rate\nInadequate infrastructure\nConstraints in supply chain and logistics\nLack of funds for R&D\nInﬂexible labor laws\nLimited focus on electronics exportsDemand — s upply \nmismatch\n\n83\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking • ► India’s corporate taxation rate is higher than that of the sample set of countries, which \nmakes the final product less competitive than low-cost destinations such as China and \nTaiwan. Tax-rate benchmarking of all sample countries has been done in Chapter 6.b.\n• ► The GoI also needs to ramp up infrastructure development in the country. Chapter 5 of \nthis report details the benchmarking of several infrastructure-related parameters.\n• ► Supply chain and logistics constraints, inflexible labor laws and limited focus on exports \nare others issues that need to be addressed to boost electronics manufacturing in the \ncountry.\n• ► India is one of the leaders among the sample set of countries in producing engineers \nequipped with the requisite skills for electronics production. The country’s abundant \ntalent pool and resources can be utilized to produce high-value products; thus, domestic \nvalue addition may be encouraged and incentivized. Talent-pool benchmarking has been \ndetailed in Chapter 2.\n• ► The GoI should encourage products specifically designed for India. The developmental \nsector can benefit from biometric readers, smart meters, micro-payment devices, and \nlow-cost medical devices.\n• ► Improvements in these factors are likely to help local manufacturers compete with the \nprices of imported finished goods.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry84\n1.c. Semiconductor design companies\nThe number of fabless semiconductor design units is a direct indicator of a semiconductor \ndesign sector’s maturity in any given country. \nExhibit 6 depicts the number of semiconductor design units in various countries. \nKey observations\n• ► The US leads the sample set with the highest number of design units. The country has \n507 design units. \n• ► China is a close second with 472 design units.\n• ► India ranks fifth among the sample set countries, with around 120 design units in \noperation.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► Taiwan, which has adopted a cluster-based approach, is home to more design companies \nthan India, as it has a well-developed semiconductor ecosystem with fabrication, \nassembly testing and packaging (ATP) units, along with design units. The section on \ngeographic concentration or fragmentation of the semiconductor industry discusses \nsemiconductor clusters in the sample set of countries.\n• ► Several global integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) have set up captive design centers \nin India in the past decade. Several IDMs have also started outsourcing projects to third-\nparty design houses in India. This has led to the establishment of a large number of \nindependent design houses in India in the past decade.\n• ► India needs to encourage the establishment of fabrication units and ATP companies, \nsince the development of an entire semiconductor ecosystem may also give an impetus \nto the establishment of design units in the country.

Geographic concentration/fragmentation of design industry\nGeographic concentration/fragmentation is an indicator of how semiconductor design \nactivities across the country are distributed. High fragmentation implies that design \ncenters are dispersed throughout the country. A cluster-based approach tends to be \nmore successful, as it focuses on linkages and interdependence between companies while \nproducing products and services and creating innovations.\nCluster formation captures interdependencies as well as economies of scale and scope. \nIt reduces transaction costs, results in the development of new skills and speeds up \nlearning processes.\nSome countries in the sample set have well-defined semiconductor clusters, which include \nintegrated circuit (IC) design companies, fabrication units, and packaging and testing \ncompanies, all under one roof. This allows for competition as well as cooperation and \nintegration, which facilitate the overall development of the industry. \nExhibit 7 lists the regions where the majority of semiconductor design activity in each \ncountry is conducted.\nCountry Semiconductor design activity in cities/clusters \nIndia The majority of semiconductor design centers are spread across Bengaluru, the \nNational Capital Region (NCR), Hyderabad and Pune.\nChina China has more than 100 “high-technology parks” scattered throughout the \ncountry. Relatively large and more concentrated clusters are emerging in \nZhangjiang, Suzhou and Beijing.\nTaiwan The country’s semiconductor cluster is located in Hsinchu Science Park near \nTaipei.\nNankang Software Park also has an IC design park.\nUK Several fabless semiconductor players, especially start-ups, have a presence in \nSouthwest England — Bristol, Bath, Plymouth and Gloucester.\nOxford, Southampton and Surrey in Southeast England are focused on \napplication engineering and hardware design in the semiconductor ecosystem.\nCambridge in East England has a healthy number of semiconductor design \ncompanies focused on device- and application-based markets.\nSweden Stockholm, Lund, Göteborg and Linköping are four clusters in Sweden with the \nhighest concentration of the semiconductor industry.\nUS Semiconductor clusters in the US are located in Silicon Valley, Texas, New \nMexico and Arizona.\nIsrael Semiconductor design units can be found in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Herzliya, Migdal \nHa’emek, Holon, Beer Sheva and Dimona.\nGermany Semiconductor clusters in Germany are located in Dresden, Dortmund, Munich, \nBerlin and Hamburg.\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 124 Exhibit 7\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry86\nCase study: the Cambridge cluster \n“Silicon Fen,” as the cluster is popularly known as, is located in the Cambridge region in East \nEngland. High-technology companies engaged in electronics and software have a strong \npresence in this cluster. Silicon Fen has several semiconductor design companies that focus \non device- and application-based markets. The cluster came into existence in 1970s, when \na large number of high-technology spin-offs from the University of Cambridge established \nbusinesses to meet the growing international demand for high-tech output. In the 1980s, \nthis cluster produced more patents per capita than the UK average. Subsequently, the \ncluster grew rapidly along with the emergence of computer services firms and companies \ninvolved in R&D.\nIts proximity to the University of Cambridge has been cited as the prime reason behind its \ndevelopment. The university is a major source of highly skilled and qualified manpower. The \navailability of competitive manpower addresses the need of the semiconductor sector, which \nis highly knowledge-intensive. High-technology companies located in the cluster collaborate \nwith related departments at the University of Cambridge for R&D activities by setting up \nresearch laboratories on campus. Easy access to finance is another important factor. Venture \ncapital firms and local intermediaries provide financial assistance to firms situated in the \ncluster. The university remains a breeding ground for several technology start-ups, which set \nup their operations in the cluster. A combination of all these reasons has led to the formation \nof a well-established semiconductor industry in this part of the UK.\nTakeaways for India\n• India can learn from China and Taiwan, where the respective governments have \npromoted the formation of a semiconductor ecosystem through a cluster-based \napproach. This has led to the rapid development of captive and independent design \ncenters in these countries, due to which they are ahead of India in terms of number of \ndesign units.\n• The GoI needs to take steps to develop fabrication and ATP units in the country. The \ncreation of clusters hosting the entire value chain of the semiconductor sector needs to \nbe promoted in order to facilitate consolidation and overall industry development.\n\n87\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Industry dynamics: summary \nThe Indian semiconductor design sector is fairly developed, with around 120 design \nunits. The country is ranked second among the sample set of countries in terms of design \nrevenues. Several global integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) have set up captive design \ncenters in India in the past decade. \nBengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and the NCR collectively account for the majority of \nsemiconductor design activity in India. India can give further impetus to this industry by \ndrawing from industry experience in Taiwan and China, countries that have adopted a \ncluster-based approach and developed a mature semiconductor ecosystem with fabrication \nand ATP units to complement design units.\nThe rapidly growing electronics market in India has resulted in increased demand for \nsemiconductor components. As such, the electronics industry is expected to serve as one of \nthe primary growth drivers of the country’s semiconductor industry in future.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry88\n2. Talent pool\nThis chapter focuses on the second benchmarking parameter — talent pool.\nThe talent pool parameter represents the number of engineers currently employed in \nsemiconductor design. The category also includes the annual addition to the relevant \nengineering pool. Relevant engineers are those, who are qualified in electrical design, \nelectronics, telecommunications, computer engineering or electronic design.\nThe benchmarking parameters considered in this category are:\n• Current size of the relevant engineering talent in semiconductor design (Bachelor’s \ndegree and above)\n• Number of relevant engineering degrees awarded per year (Bachelor’s degree and \nabove)\n• Number of technical institutes that offer engineering degrees\nThese parameters are indicators of the current supply of talent for the semiconductor \nsector as well as of the potential for future scalability.\nThe majority of talent pool data has been collected from websites of government education \ndepartments and statistical databases of countries in the sample set.Exhibit 8\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

The country ranks first among the sample set countries on this parameter.\n• Israel produces 2,367 engineers every year and ranks last in the sample set on this \nparameter.\n• Producing around 221,953 engineers graduating each year with relevant degrees, India \nranks second on this parameter.\nTakeaways for India\n• Exhibit 10 indicates that within the sample set, India is among the best-placed countries \nin terms of future scalability of relevant talent.\n• India is also well-placed in terms of the proportion of relevant engineers with respect to \ntotal engineers, since close to 61% of engineers produced every year in the country are \nequipped with skills relevant for the semiconductor design sector. Only Taiwan is ahead \nof India in terms of this proportion, as approximately 79% of engineers graduating every \nyear in this country are relevant for the design sector.\n• Therefore, India is one of the leading countries in terms of the potential it offers through \nits supply of engineers equipped with relevant skills for the sector.Exhibit 10: Supply of relevant engineers every year\n020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaNumber of engineers221,953 408,253\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 125\n\n91\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking 2.c. Number of technical institutes\nThe number of technical institutes in a country reflects the country’s ability to produce \nengineering graduates each year. The higher the number of engineering colleges, the \nhigher is the number of professionals produced every year, equipped with requisite skills for \nsemiconductor design. \nExhibit 11 compares the sample set of countries on the basis of the number of institutions \nthat provide engineering education.\nKey observations\n• ► With 2,872 engineering colleges in the country, India scores the highest on this \nparameter in the sample set.\n• ► Israel ranks last among the sample set of countries as it has only 17 universities and \ncolleges that offer engineering degrees.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► India has the highest number of engineering colleges among the sample set of countries. \nThe country produces the second-highest number of engineering graduates among the \nsample set. \n• ► In India infrastructure for technical education is poised on unprecedented growth as \na result of several initiatives. These include the recent establishment of 8 new Indian \nInstitutes of Technology (IITs) and the Eleventh Five Year Plan’s vision to set up 10 \nnew National Institutes of Technology (NITs), 3 Indian Institutes of Science Education & \nResearch (IISERs) and 20 Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs).Exhibit 11: Number of technical institutes per country\n2,872\n050100150200250300350400450500550600\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaNumber of colleges\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 126\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry92\nTalent pool: summary \nIndia is a strong performer on the parameters of current and future availability of \nengineering talent. The country features among the top three in the sample set in terms \nof engineers employed in the semiconductor design sector as well as relevant degree \ngraduates being produced each year.\nIndia also has the highest number of engineering colleges among the sample set of \ncountries. Consequently, it is among the leading countries in the sample set in terms of \nthe number of engineers that graduate in the country each year. The growing number \nof engineering colleges in India is expected to increase the number of skilled graduates. \nThe country has the second-highest proportion of relevant engineers with respect to total \nengineers graduating annually.\nTherefore, from the current availability and scalability perspective, and considering the \nstrengthening of its talent pool following the return of expatriates, India is among the best-\nplaced countries for semiconductor design.\n\n93\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking 3. Innovation environment\nThis chapter focuses on the third benchmarking parameter — innovation environment.\nThe implementation of several innovative activities is a reflection of the innovative quality \nof a country’s environment. This category deals with a country’s innovation capabilities. \nThe benchmarking parameters used in this category are:\n• Quality of scientific research institutions\n• Company spending on R&D\n• Number of IEEE papers submitted \nThe information on these parameters has been collected from the World Economic Forum \n(WEF)’s Global Competitiveness Report 2010–2011. The comparison on the parameters \nabove reflects a country’s overall innovation environment, and is not specific to the \nsemiconductor design sector.Exhibit 12\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Research and development\nCompanies need to design and develop innovative products and processes to create and \nsustain competitive advantage. This requires investment in R&D and collaboration between \nuniversities and the industry for research.\nThe presence of high-quality research institutes facilitates R&D activity in a country by \nmaking available the requisite resources for the development of new technologies. \nThe benchmarking of countries to indicate their research and development environment has \nbeen done on the following parameters:\n• ► Quality of scientific research institutions\n• ► Company spending on R&D\nExhibit 13 depicts the rankings of the countries on the parameters mentioned above.\nA high ranking on the quality of scientific research institutions parameter indicates that the \ninstitutes are regarded as best in their category internationally.\nThe countries where companies spend more money on R&D activities are ranked higher than \nothers in the sample set.\nKey observations\nQuality of scientific research institutes:\n• Israel is the best-ranked country in the sample set as well as globally in terms of quality of \nscientific research institutes.\n• China, with a global rank of 39, ranks last among the sample set of countries.\n• India, with a global rank of 30, ranks seventh in the sample set.Exhibit 13: Global rankings on research and development environment parameters\n051015202530354045\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaGlobal rankings\nQuality of scientiﬁc research institutions Company spending on R&D\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 126\n\n95\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Company spending on R&D:\n• Sweden ranks the highest among the sample set of countries as well as globally in terms \nof company spending on R&D.\n• India, with a global rank of 37, ranks last among the sample set of countries.\nTakeaways for India\n• India provides companies with a favorable environment in which to set up R&D facilities. \nGlobal MNCs such as General Electric (GE) have established their research centers in the \ncountry. GE’s John F Welch Technology Centre, which was established in Bengaluru in \n2000, is one of the company’s first R&D facilities outside the US. Since its operational \ninception, the center has filed around 180 patents.\n• Leading companies in the semiconductor industry have also set up their captive centers \nin the country to conduct R&D activities. The number of patents filed by India operations \nof companies such as Texas Instruments (TI), ST Microelectronics (STM), Intel and \nBroadcom Corporation between 2005 and 2009 is 181, 120, 54 and 51, respectively.\n• The R&D talent pool of MNCs in India has also seen rapid growth in the past decade. The \nnumber of MNC employees working at their respective R&D centers in India has increased \nfrom 16,000 in 2000 to 180,000 in 2009, growing at a CAGR of 30.9%. This number \nis further expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% to reach 319,000 in 2015. On the other \nhand, China also had approximately 16,000 MNC personnel employed at R&D centers in \n2000. This has increased to 130,000 in 2009, growing at a CAGR of approximately 26%. \nThus, India is ahead of China in terms of the R&D initiatives that MNCs in the countries \nare adopting.\n• India lags behind other countries in the sample set in terms of company spending on \nR&D activities. Although the GoI provides certain tax exemptions on R&D expenditure by \ncompanies, it needs to provide more incentives to encourage companies to spend more \non R&D.\n• India also needs to improve the quality of research institutions in order to remain an \nattractive destination for MNCs wanting to conduct R&D activities in the country. \n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry96\n3.b. Number of IEEE papers submitted\nThe number of IEEE papers submitted reflects the country’s ability to conduct research and \ninnovate new designs for the semiconductor industry. High number of IEEE papers filed from a \ncountry indicates a greater level of involvement in innovation activities.\nExhibit 14 compares the sample set of countries on the basis of the number of IEEE papers \nfiled from a country. The statistics on IEEE papers are sourced from the IEEE societies of \ncomputer, software, design and test of computers, transaction on computers and software \nengineering.\nKey observations\n• ► The US ranks first on this parameter with the highest number of IEEE papers submitted for \n2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively.\n• ► Number of IEEE papers filed from Sweden is 7, 9 and 10 for 2005, 2007 and 2009, \nrespectively. The country ranks last on this parameter.\n• ► In India, the number of IEEE papers is 57, 84 and 95 for 2005, 2007 and 2009, \nrespectively. In terms of 2009 rankings among sample set countries, India is ranked third \nafter the US and China.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► The number of papers submitted from India has grown from 57 in 2005 to 95 in 2009, \nindicating an absolute growth rate of 66.6% in four years. India is ranked higher than all the \nother countries except Taiwan in terms of this growth rate.\n• ► India’s share in terms of world submission of IEEE papers has also increased from 4.9% in \n2005 to 6% in 2009 indicating a higher level of research activities being carried out in the \ncountry.\n• ► Although the above figures indicate the submission of IEEE papers, India needs to improve \nthe acceptance rates of papers submitted. In 2010, acceptance rate of India’s papers was \n4.5%, which is very low as compared to countries such as the US, the UK and Germany, \nwhich have acceptance rates of 37.6%, 34.2% and 21.7%, respectively. This indicates a \nrelative lack of quality in research work carried out in India.

India’s availability of skilled talent and high-quality scientific research institutes are \nprimary reasons for its growing reputation as an attractive country for the establishment of \nR&D centers. A number of Indian captives of global semiconductor companies file patents \nevery year, which indicates the level of IP being created. \nThe country also ranks favorably in terms of the number of IEEE papers filed from the \ncountry in the fields relevant for semiconductor design. Since India lags behind other \ncountries in the sample set in terms of company spending on R&D, the GoI needs to provide \nmore incentives to encourage R&D activity in India.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry98\n4. Operating costs\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth benchmarking parameter — operating costs.\nOperating costs for semiconductor design units include salaries of semiconductor design \nprofessionals, electricity costs, office space rent, the cost of bandwidth and design tools, \nand miscellaneous expenses. For the purpose of this benchmarking study, the cost of design \ntools has not been taken into account, since it is almost standard across the globe for a \ngiven multinational semiconductor company. This is because companies purchase global \nlicenses for tools, which can be used by their design centers in different time zones. The \nbenchmarking parameters analyzed in this category are:\n• Average annual rentals of office space\n• Average cost of electricity\n• Average annual salary of semiconductor design personnel\n• Cost of raising debt\n• ► Travel costs\nInformation on office space rentals has been collected using research reports published by \nglobal real estate consulting majors such as Jones Lang Lasalle and CB Richard Ellis. \nThe majority of the data on electricity tariffs has been collected from websites of \ngovernment energy departments and statistical databases of countries in the sample set. \nData on prime lending rates for most of the countries has been obtained from the websites \nof central banks of the respective countries.Exhibit 15\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Annual average office space rentals\nThe amount of rent that companies pay for office space constitutes a major chunk of \ncompanies’ operating costs. The countries that offer high-quality office space at relatively \nlow rent are seen as favorable business destinations. \nExhibit 16 depicts the comparison between countries on the basis of average annual rentals \nof Grade A office space in terms of US$ per sq. m. per annum. The rentals are for office \nspace in central business districts (CBD) and suburban business districts (SBD) in important \ncities in each country. The average has been computed by providing 80% weight to rentals at \nlow-cost locations and 20% weight to rentals at high-cost locations within a country.\nKey observations\n• ► Israel ranks the highest on this parameter, with average annual rentals of \nUS$224 per sq. m. per annum.\n• ► With US$587 per sq. m. per annum, Sweden is home to the costliest office spaces.\n• ► Other developed countries such as the US and the UK also rank low on this parameter.\n• ► India, with US$278 average annual rentals for Grade A office space, has one of the \nlowest rentals among the sample set of countries. It ranks third on this parameter, closely \nfollowing Taiwan, where rentals are US$271 per sq. m. per annum.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► India performs well on this parameter, and with nearly 21 million sq. ft. of Grade A office \nspace expected to be developed in the next one year in major cities and a high current \nvacancy rate, average annual rentals in India are expected to remain low vis-à-vis other \ncountries in the sample set.

Average cost of electricity\nElectricity costs constitute an important constituent of operational cost, but assume less \nsignificance, since semiconductor design is not power intensive.\nExhibit 17 represents average cost of electricity per unit (1 unit = 1 Kilowatt hour) in \nUS cents for commercial consumers in a country. \nKey observations\n• ► With the lowest per unit cost of electricity among the sample set of countries, Taiwan \nranks first on this parameter. \n• ► Germany, where commercial customers pay approximately US$0.20 per unit for \nelectricity ranks last. \n• ► India ranks seventh on this parameter ahead of Germany. Commercial customers in India \npay around US$0.17 per unit of electricity.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► Apart from being a power-deficit nation, India has one of the highest per unit costs \namong the sample set of countries.\n• ► Although the semiconductor design sector is not power-intensive, low electricity costs \nhelp reduce overall operating costs for companies, therefore enhancing a country’s cost-\ncompetitive edge.Exhibit 17: Average cost of electricity\n0510152025\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaElectricity cost (US cents per KWh)\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 127\n\n101\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking 4.c. Average annual salaries of semiconductor design personnel\nThe semiconductor design sector requires a highly skilled and trained workforce. Human \nresource costs, thus, constitute a major expense for semiconductor design companies, as \nskilled personnel come at relatively low salaries.\nExhibit 18 compares the countries on the basis of average salaries of semiconductor design \nprofessionals in terms of US$ per annum.\nKey observations\n• ► With annual compensation of around US$16,900, semiconductor design professionals \nemployed in China draw the lowest salaries among the sample set of countries.\n• ► Average annual salaries of semiconductor design professionals working in the US are the \nhighest. The estimated figure is around US$93,669.\n• ► Other developed countries also have much higher levels of salary as compared to \ndeveloping countries.\n• ► The average salary cost in India is US$29,246, which places the country second among \nthe sample set of countries.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► India performs very well in terms of salaries of semiconductor design professionals. \nAverage salaries in India are higher than in China but significantly lower than all the \ndeveloped countries in the sample set.\n• ► With a large number of skilled graduates being produced in India every year, the country \nis expected to maintain this talent cost advantage in future. Benchmarking on the \nnumber of relevant engineers produced in a country has been discussed in Chapter 2.b.Exhibit 18: Average annual salary of semiconductor design personnel\n010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00090,000100,000\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaAverage annual salary (in US$)\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 127\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry102\n4.d. Cost of raising debt\nNew businesses require adequate funding from different sources to establish their \noperations. The cost of raising debt from banks affects the profitability of businesses, as \ninterest costs may constitute one of the major cost components for startups. The higher the \ninterest cost in a country, the lower is the incentive to set up a new business.\nExhibit 19 compares the sample set of countries on the basis of the prime lending rates \noffered by commercial banks in the country. Prime lending rate is the underlying index that \nbanks use to determine the interest rate they offer to their customers on the basis of their \ncredit rating.\nKey observations\n• ► The UK ranks first on this parameter, with the lowest interest cost in the sample set.\n• ► Banks in India offer a base interest rate of around 8%, which is highest among the sample \nset of countries. Therefore, the country ranks last on this parameter.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► High interest cost is a deterrent for new businesses seeking to initiate operations. \nCommercial banks in India should encourage start-ups by reducing the thrust on \ncollateral security and offering loan on more liberal terms.\n• ► Banks in India also need to streamline their credit-appraisal process to reduce the time to \nsanction loans and, thus, enhance the ease of obtaining loans.

Travel cost\nTravel cost is an important parameter under consideration, because employees of \nmultinational companies are required to travel to different countries across the world for \nbusiness-related activities. Travel cost has been estimated by taking the average of per diem \nrates in major cities of a country. This rate covers lodging, meals and incidental expenses.\nExhibit 20 compares per diem rates across sample set countries.\nKey observations\n• The US ranks first on this parameter, with the lowest per diem rate of US$159 in the \nsample set of countries.\n• Sweden, with the highest per diem rate of US$404, ranks last among the sample set of \ncountries.\n• India ranks fourth on this parameter, closely behind Germany, with an average per diem \nrate of US$349.\nTakeaways for India\n• India is an expensive business destination in terms of travel charges as compared to \nother developing countries such as China and Taiwan.\n• The high charges of business hotels and costly local travel are major components leading \nto India’s high value of per diem charges. Exhibit 20: Per diem rate\n050100150200250300350400450\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaPer diem cost (in US$)\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 128\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry104\nOperating costs: summary \nIndia is highly competitive in terms of two major components of operating costs for \nbusinesses. Salary cost forms the major component of operating costs for design \ncompanies. Grade A office space rentals in India are among the lowest in the sample set of \ncountries. A high ranking on these parameters makes India an attractive destination for the \nestablishment of captive design units by companies in the US and Europe.\nThe cost of raising debt in India is the highest among the sample set of countries. Interest \ncost is not an important parameter from the perspective of captives, since these are \ngenerally cost centers; however, it is very important for new business start-ups. Travel costs \nin India are high as compared to developing nations such as China and Taiwan.\nThe cost of electricity is also high in India but it is not a major cause for concern, since the \nsemiconductor design sector is not power-intensive.\n\n105\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking 5. Infrastructure\nThis chapter focuses on the fifth benchmarking parameter – infrastructure.\nThe availability of quality physical infrastructure is important for the efficient working of \nany business in a country. It includes quality office space, adequate international internet \nbandwidth, reliable supply of electricity and sound connectivity with developed markets.\nThe benchmarking parameters in this category are:\n• Future availability of Grade A-quality office space\n• Demand-supply gap in power\n• Availability of communications infrastructure\nData on office space has been collected using research reports published by global real \nestate consulting majors. \nThe majority of electricity statistics has been collected from the websites of government \nenergy departments and statistical databases of countries in the sample set.\nThe quality of overall infrastructure rating has been obtained from the WEF’s Global \nCompetitiveness Report 2010–2011 .Exhibit 21\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Future availability of Grade A office space\nCompanies looking to establish business in a country require quality office space with \nadequate facilities to conduct their operations.\nGrade A office space consists of buildings that are newly constructed or recently redeveloped \nat prime locations in major cities. These offices boast of high-quality furnishings, the latest \nfacilities, and excellent accessibility. Thus, these are the most sought-after locations for \nmultinational companies looking to establish offices.\nExhibit 22 compares the future availability of Grade A-quality office space in each \ncountry across key cities. Expected supply takes into account new construction that is \ncurrently in progress and is expected to be completed in the next one year in major cities \nacross the country.\nKey observations\n• In terms of future availability of office space, China and the US are the leading countries \nwith a significant pipeline of upcoming office infrastructure.\n• Taiwan, followed by Sweden, has the smallest pipeline of new office space.\n• There is a major pipeline of Grade A office space planned for India, with around \n21 million sq. ft. to be added in the next one year. The country ranks third after China \nand the US in terms of future availability of high-quality office space.\nTakeaways for India\n• The fast pace of economic development, leading to the establishment of new businesses \nand rapid expansion by existing companies, is a prime factor for such rapid development \nof office space infrastructure.\n• Mumbai and Bengaluru are the leading cities in India in terms of current and future \navailability of Grade A office space.Exhibit 22: Future availability of Grade A ofﬁce space\n05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaExpected supply (in '000 square feet)\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 128\n\n107\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking 5.b. Power demand-supply gap\nPower is an important infrastructure parameter, as companies do not consider countries with \npower deficit as attractive investment locations to set up operations. Businesses operating \nin such countries have to invest in power backup infrastructure, which increases set-up and \noperating costs. \nExhibit 23 compares the power demand and supply situation between countries in the \nsample set.\nKey observations\n• Germany leads the sample set of countries in terms of the demand-supply scenario, with \napproximately 10% excess power generation as compared to demand. \n• China ranks last on this parameter, with around 7% deficiency in supply.\n• Among developed countries, the UK is the only country that is power deficient, and meets \nits demand through import of electricity. \n• India faces a power deficit of 6.85% and features among the lowest ranks on this parameter. \nHowever, India performs slightly better than China, which faces a similar demand- \nsupply gap.\nTakeaways for India\n• The electricity supply situation has improved in India over the years due to enhanced \npower-generation capacity and the entry of several private players in the power \ngeneration sector.\n• Power-generation capacity in India is currently around 162,367 MW.\n• The power demand-supply gap is expected to reduce further in future on account of several \npower projects in the pipeline.\n• Although the semiconductor design sector is not power-intensive, India still needs to tackle \noutages from time to time in major cities by improving power-distribution infrastructure. \n• Assured and uninterrupted power supply is likely to reduce the cost of investing in \nback-up sources.Exhibit 23: Power demand-supply gap\n-10%-8%-6%-4%-2%0%2%4%6%8%10%\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaSupply exceeds \ndemand\nDemand exceeds \nsupply\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 128\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry108\n5.c. Availability of communications infrastructure\nCommunications infrastructure in a country is an indicator of the country’s international \nconnectivity. Developing nations are home to several captive design centers of US- and \nEurope-based companies. As a result, they require high-quality international connectivity. \nFurther, developed nations possess quality infrastructure with sufficiently high bandwidth. \nTherefore, this parameter is more important from the perspective of developing nations as \ncompared to developed nations. \nExhibit 24 compares developing nations on the basis of availability of communications \ninfrastructure. This parameter has been measured using international internet bandwidth \navailability in each country. International internet bandwidth is the contracted capacity of \ninternational connections between countries for transmitting internet traffic.\nKey observations\n• ► China leads among the developing countries in the sample set with a bandwidth of 846 \nGbps.\n• ► Israel has the lowest bandwidth among the developing nations.\n• ► India ranks second among the developing nations. Its bandwidth capacity of 368 Gbps is \nsimilar to that of Taiwan (363 Gbps).\nTakeaways for India\n• ► India has made rapid progress on this parameter over the years, and bandwidth is no \nlonger a constraint. \n• ► India now has ample bandwidth to provide companies with high-quality \ninternational connectivity.Exhibit 24: Availability of communications infrastructure\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900IndiaIsraelTaiwanChina\nBandwidth (in Gbps)\nSource: Multiple; refer references on page 129\n\n109\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Infrastructure: summary \nOver the years, India has advanced rapidly in terms of quality infrastructure. The country’s \ngrowing economy has led to the rapid expansion of businesses. This has resulted in the \nconstruction of new, high-quality office buildings and the development of special economic \nzones (SEZs) across the country. With a high vacancy rate, currently and a large number \nof constructions in the pipeline, India is well-poised to provide high-quality office space to \ncompanies that want to set up operations in India.\nThe power demand-supply gap in India has also improved over the years, although the \ncountry remains a power-deficient economy. With a number of private players entering the \npower-generation business, India’s power-supply scenario is set to improve in future.\nIndia has overcome its bandwidth constraints of the past and now has ample capacity to \nprovide high-speed international connectivity to companies.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry110\n6. Quality of the business environment\nThis chapter focuses on the fourth benchmarking parameter — operating costs.\nQuality of business environment determines the ease of doing business in a country. \nBusiness environment includes factors such as the complexity involved in starting a new \nbusiness and taxation rates in the country. IP rights protection is important to safeguard the \nrights and interests of businesses engaged in R&D. Since the semiconductor design industry \ninvolves substantial IP creation, it is very important that a country’s legal framework is \nefficient enough to prevent IP-related thefts by implementing strict laws.\nThe benchmarking parameters used in this category are:\n• ► Number of procedures required to start a business \n• ► Corporate taxation rate\n• ► Efficiency of the legal framework in challenging regulations\nInformation on these parameters has been collected from WEF’s Global Competitiveness \nReport 2010–2011 and the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s \nDoing Business 2011 report by the World Bank. Information on the parameters and their \ncomparison reflects the business environment in the countries as a whole, and is not specific \nto the semiconductor design sector.Exhibit 25\nBenchmarking parametersIndustry dynamics1.

Number of procedures to start a business\nLegal regulations of a country require certain procedures to be completed to incorporate and \nregister the new firm before it can start operations. Countries with efficient processes have a \nhigher entry rate as they encourage entrepreneurs to set up businesses.\nExhibit 26 compares the countries in the sample set on the basis of number of procedures to \nstart a business.\nKey observations\n• ► Sweden ranks the highest among the sample set of countries in terms of number of \nprocedures to start a new business. Companies need to complete only three procedures \nto start a new business in Sweden.\n• ► China requires 14 procedures to be completed before a new business can become \noperational. It ranks last on this parameter.\n• ► India requires 12 procedures to be completed and, therefore, features among the lowest \nranked on this parameter. It lags behind all countries in the sample set except China. \n• ► According to Doing Business 2011, it takes 8 procedures on an average to start a \nbusiness around the world. India lags behind the world average.\nTakeaways for India\n• ► Typical procedures in India include registering the company name with the Registrar \nof Companies (ROC), getting the company incorporated, making a seal, obtaining a \npermanent account number (PAN) and tax account number, and registering for Value \nAdded Tax (VAT), professional tax, and employees provident fund organization (EPFO).\n• ► India could improve on this parameter by implementing simpler and faster procedures. \nIt can also work on transitioning some procedures online to decrease the time and \ncomplexities involved.Exhibit 26: Number of procedures to start a business\n0246810121416\nUSWorld average = 8 \nUK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaNumber of procedures\nSource: Doing Business 2011, World Bank, IFC and Palgrave MacMillan, October 2010\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry112\n6.b. Corporate taxation rate\nThe competitiveness, investment and growth of businesses can be restricted by governments \nby imposing heavy taxes. High tax rates lower the profits of companies and are thus \ndiscouraging for businesses.\nExhibit 27 compares the statutory corporate taxation rate in each country. \nKey observations\n• Germany ranks the highest on this parameter, with a corporate taxation rate of 15%. \n• ► The US, with a corporate taxation rate of 34%, ranks last on this parameter.\n• ► With a 30% corporate tax rate, India has the highest rate among the developing countries \nin the sample set.Exhibit 27: Statutory corporate taxation rate\n0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaCorporate tax rate\nSource: Doing Business 2011, World Bank, IFC and Palgrave MacMillan, October 2010\n\n113\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Takeaways for India\n• Apart from corporate tax, companies are required to pay other taxes in all countries. \nThese include turnover tax, labor taxes, personal income tax withheld by the company, \nVAT or sales tax, property tax, property transfer tax, dividend tax, capital gains tax, \nfinancial transactions tax, waste collection tax, vehicle and road taxes and other small \ntaxes (such as stamp duty and local taxes).\n• ► In India, the composition of other taxes is as follows (as % of gross profits): \n• Central Sales Tax (17.1%)\n• Social security contributions (13.5%)\n• Employee state insurance contribution (4.6%)\n• Property tax (3.3%)\n• Dividend tax (3.8%)\n• Fuel tax (0.4%)\n• Fringe benefit tax (0.1%)\n• Tax on insurance contracts (0.2%)\n• ► In 2009—10, Israel and China reduced corporate income tax rates, thereby increasing \ntheir competitiveness by helping businesses to grow.\n• ► Although corporate taxation in India is higher than that in other countries within \nthe sample set, the GoI provides a number of tax incentives to companies setting up \noperations in SEZs and STPIs. As an example, companies engaged in the export of \ngoods and services are eligible for 100% income tax exemption for the first five years of \noperations and 50% exemption for the next five years of operations.\n• ► As discussed in Chapter 1 on industry dynamics, a stable tax structure needs to \nbe in place in order to encourage companies to make long-term investments in the \nsemiconductor design and electronics production sector.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry114\n6.c. Legal framework efficiency in challenging regulations\nThe legal framework of a country is important for the development of the country’s \ninnovation capabilities. Companies that possess IP are not likely to be willing to invest \nin innovation and R&D if their rights as IP owners are insecure. This requires a business \nenvironment that supports innovation. An efficient legal framework helps protect the \ncompanies’ IP and settles disputes quickly and effectively. Therefore, it encourages \ncompanies to undertake more R&D activities.\nExhibit 28 depicts the rankings of the countries on the efficiency of the legal framework \nin challenging regulations. The more efficient is the country’s legal framework for private \nbusinesses in challenging the legality of government actions and regulations, the higher is \nthe country’s ranking on this parameter. \nKey observations\n• ► Sweden ranks best among the sample set of countries, as well as globally indicating a \nhighly efficient framework in challenging regulations.\n• ► China has a global rank of 51, and ranks last among the sample set of countries.\n• ► With a global rank of 37, India ranks fifth in the sample set, ahead of China, Taiwan \nand Israel.Exhibit 28: Global rankings on efﬁciency of the legal framework in challenging regulations \n0510152025303540455055\nUS UK Germany Sweden China Taiwan Israel IndiaGlobal rankings\nSource: Global competitiveness report 2010–2011, The World Economic Forum\n\n115\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Takeaways for India\n• India ranks higher than other developing countries in terms of its legal framework’s \nefficiency in challenging government regulations. \n• In terms of the IP protection scenario in India with respect to the semiconductor design \nsector, a discussion with semiconductor industry professionals in India indicates that \ncompanies largely consider the country to be ahead of China. IP protection laws for the \nsemiconductor design sector are more stringent in India than in China. \n• To be able to further drive innovation, India’s IP protection regime needs improvement \nthrough the implementation of strict laws. The Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout \nDesign (SICLD) Act, 2000 governs integrated circuit (IC) layout designs in India. \n• The act is aimed to protect IP rights for semiconductor IC design layouts.\n• Layout design shall be registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing \nthe application or from the date of first commercial use anywhere in India or in any \ncountry, whichever is earlier.\n• Layout design that is not commercially exploited for more than two years from its \ndate of registration shall be treated as commercially exploited for the purpose of this \nact.\n• Reproducing, distributing, selling or importing the IC layout design for commercial \npurposes will lead to infringement of law.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry116\nQuality of business environment: summary \nIndia lags behind developed nations in terms of overall quality of business environment. The \nnumber of procedures required to start a new business in India are on the higher side. It \ncould improve on this aspect by simplifying the steps involved to set up a new business and \nenabling the online completion of some procedures. \nFurther, in terms of taxation, the GoI imposes several taxes, apart from corporate tax, \nwhich reduce profitability. To improve India’s attractiveness as a business destination, the \nGoI should reduce the burden of taxes on startups. \nThe efficiency of the legal framework in India will play a major role in the development of \nthe country’s innovation capabilities in the near future. India already has a Semiconductor \nIC Design Layout Act in place to protect the interests of IP owners of semiconductor \ndesign. While India performs better than other developing countries in terms of efficiency \nof its legal framework in challenging government regulations, GoI needs to make the legal \nframework more efficient by resolving disputes more efficiently and timely.\n\n117\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Government policies and support\nThe semiconductor design sector involves a lot of expenditure on R&D. Government \nsupport in the form of R&D incentives, tax holidays and loan grants can help companies \nsustain research initiatives and remain profitable. Government support in developing \nfabrication, assembly testing and packaging units, and for other sectors related to \nsemiconductors, such as electronics, help create an overall ecosystem in the country. These \ninitiatives help a country become a favorable investment destination.\nThe countries in the sample set provide businesses engaged in the semiconductor and \nrelated sectors with different kinds of incentives. Prominent among these are:\nTaiwan\nThe Government of Taiwan has taken several initiatives to reduce risks and enhance the \ncompetitiveness and innovation capability of businesses engaged in research activities. \nThe Government of Taiwan has developed the Hsin-chu Science-based Industrial Park \n(HSIP) following the model of Silicon Valley in the US to create an environment conducive \nto the development of a high-technology industry (including semiconductors). The park’s \nproximity to two of Taiwan’s oldest universities gives it the advantages of a skilled labor \nsupply and low employee training costs, apart from the advantages an industrial cluster \nenjoys. The Government of Taiwan also provides for zero tax, exemption from import duties \nand certain other taxes on products manufactured for export in more such designated \nscience parks.\nIn order to provide companies with technological and R&D support, the Government of \nTaiwan has established research institutions such as the Industrial Technology Research \nInstitute (ITRI), which has several laboratories that collaborate with private-sector \ncompanies to build their research competitiveness. The National Science and Technology \nProjects (NSTP) provide financial stability to ITRI. Some of ITRI researchers join private \nsector companies, which increase R&D capabilities of the private sector.\nThe Government of Taiwan enacted the Statute for Upgrading Industries in 1990 and \namended it in 2003. The statute encourages the hi-technology industry by providing a \nfive-year holiday on corporate income tax, applicable to the entire income for the newly \nincorporated company, and on incremental income from new construction or expansion for \npre-existing and qualifying companies.III.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry118\nA company in Taiwan is eligible for a 30% credit for R&D expenses against income tax payable \nfor five years, starting from the year the company begins R&D activity. If this expenditure \nexceeds the average of the preceding two years, 50% of the excess amount may be offset \nagainst income tax payable that year. Equipment and machinery used for R&D can be \ndepreciated completely over a two-year period.\nThe Government of Taiwan also offered a major incentive to the semiconductor design \nindustry in 2002 through the launch of a Si-Soft project. The project aimed at developing \nresources to create a skilled workforce for the semiconductor design sector and the \nestablishment of an IC design park. Under this project, the Nankang IC design science-park \nwas initiated in July 2003. This collaborative effort with Hsinchu and Tainan science-based \nindustrial parks and Nankang Software Park, aimed to increase the faculty count specializing \nin Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design at universities and introduce several new \ncourses in semiconductor design as a part of the curriculum to produce more design \nengineers annually. The overall objective was to promote IP creation by IC design units \nin Taiwan.\nChina\nSince 2000, the Government of China has been actively involved in implementing favorable \ntax policies and providing incentives to companies to develop a competitive semiconductor \nindustry. After 2000, government policies saw major changes. Before 2000, semiconductor \nfirms were mostly government-owned or joint ventures involving a government entity as \nthe Chinese partner. FDI in the sector was highly restricted. After 2000, the Government \nof China started encouraging foreign investment in the sector while holding only a passive \nminority stake in enterprises. Tariffs on semiconductors, which were in the range of 6%–30% \nbefore 2000, were completely removed. Steps were also taken to promote the IC design \nindustry. Earlier, the emphasis was on state-owned research institutes, while after 2000, the \nGovernment of China privatized these institutes and also provided financial assistance to \nprivate companies to conduct R&D activities.\nUnder the Tenth Five Year Plan, the semiconductor industry has been designated as an \nencouraged industry, and the Government of China laid down a number of policies to \npromote industry growth.\nSince 2008, China’s taxation laws for the semiconductor manufacturing sector, , have \nallowed for a five-year tax holiday involving full exemption from corporate income tax for the \nfirst five years, starting in the year in which the business becomes profitable. For the next \nfive years, these businesses are required to pay half the applicable tax rate.\nAnother incentive is the R&D tax deduction. Companies engaged in R&D activity for the \nproduction of new technologies, products, or techniques can enjoy a 50% “super deduction” \nabove the actual expense deduction. \nIC manufacturers are exempt from paying import duties and 17% VAT on IC production \nequipment and machinery. They are also granted easy customs clearance.\n\n119\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Some local incentives are also available to the semiconductor industry. For example, \nunder a “virtual fab” strategy adopted by some local governments, the construction of a \nfabrication plant is either completely or largely government-funded, but contracted private \nfirms manage the process under a profit-sharing agreement.\nAs another example, for pre-approved R&D centers, The Pudong New Area in Shanghai \nrefunds land-use fees and subsidizes property taxes under the Pudong Technology \nDevelopment Fund.\nIndia\nThe GoI provides several incentives and tax benefits to the semiconductor industry and \nrelated sectors for the overall development of the semiconductor ecosystem in India. The \nGoI offers a weighted deduction of 150% on any expenditure on in-house scientific research \nby companies engaged in electronic equipment manufacturing. Further, a 10-year tax \ndeduction is offered for 100% of profits derived from the export of certain products by \ncompanies located in SEZs, an electronic hardware technology park, and free trade zones, \namong others.\nThe GoI introduced the National Semiconductor Policy in 2007 to encourage investments \nin the establishment of fabrication units. It covers production, assembly and testing \nof semiconductors, photovoltaics, LCDs, plasmas, storage devices, solar cells and \nnanotechnology products. For the implementation of the policy, the GoI launched the \nSpecial Incentives Package Scheme (SIPS). According to this scheme, businesses setting \nup qualifying wafer-fabrication facilities with a minimum investment of US$581 million \nwill be eligible for government grants. For units located inside SEZs, the GoI will provide \n20% of the capital expenditure for the first 10 years of operations. For units outside SEZs, \ncountervailing duty (CVD) on capital goods will be exempt, and the GoI will be responsible \nfor 25% of the capital expenditure for the stated duration. The scheme limits the equity \nparticipation of the GoI in the project to a maximum of 26%, assuming a 1:1 debt equity \nratio for the project. The rest will be in the form of interest-free loans, tax subsidies \nand concessions. The policy also provides state governments with the option to offer \nsemiconductor companies additional benefits. \nSome state governments also provide incentives for the development of the semiconductor \nindustry. For example, the Government of Karnataka introduced a semiconductor policy \nin February 2010. The policy is aimed at providing financial assistance to start-up design \nunits through Karnataka Information Technology Venture Capital (KITVEN) Fund. It will also \nprovide financial assistance to firms for filing IP. The GoI plans to set up industrial parks \nand SEZs following the model of Hsinchu Park in Taiwan and Suzhou Park in China. These \nSEZs are expected to offer benefits such as low rentals on land, tax benefits, exemptions \nfrom certain tariffs and low-interest government loans.\nSome of the fiscal incentives listed in the Karnataka Industrial Policy 2009–14 include \nexemption from stamp duty to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), large and \nmega projects, an investment promotion subsidy, interest free loan on VAT to large and \nmega projects, and interest subsidy to micro manufacturing enterprises.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry120\nIsrael\nThe Government of Israel has entitled foreign investors to a 10% corporate income tax rate. \nIf the business is set up in central Israel, investors are also eligible for a two-year exemption \nfrom that tax. A 10-year full tax exemption can be provided in case the company is located \noutside of central Israel.\nTaxation laws allow for a full deduction of R&D expenses, including capital expenditures \nin the year in which the expenditures are made. Further, a qualified R&D plan makes the \ncompany eligible for grants ranging between 20%¬ and 50% of R&D expenses. Grants depend \nupon the amount of local production and the contribution of R&D to Israeli research. Non-\nIsraeli residents are eligible for full capital gain tax exemption for the sale of shares in an \n“intensive R&D company.”\nUS\nThe US Government provides the semiconductor industry with several tax incentives \nthrough the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Since 2008, the Government of the US \nhas been offering a 14% alternative credit for qualifying R&D expenditures above 50% of the \naverage qualified research expenditures over the three years before the credit year. A major \ndrawback is that this R&D incentive is on a temporary basis and lasts for one or two years. \nIt is required to be renewed after the stated period. Companies enjoy certain state-level tax \nincentives, but there is no provision of tax holidays from the US federal corporate income \ntax. The US also offers 3.15% tax deduction for manufacturing activities in the domestic \nsemiconductor sector.\nUK\nThe Government of the UK offers incentives to companies involved in R&D. Such companies \nare entitled to claim a deduction on their taxable profits if they spend at least £10,000 in \ntheir accounting year on qualifying R&D activities. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can \nclaim 175% of qualifying expenditure (incurred after 1 August 2008). Large companies can \nclaim 130% of expenditure (incurred after 1 April 2008).\nSMEs making losses are eligible to claim credit of 24% of qualifying expenditure. Further, \nSMEs are not required to own any IP attributable to their R&D expenditure as a condition of \nbeing able to claim.\nCompanies are allowed to claim R&D tax credits to incur costs on employing staff engaged \nin conducting R&D activities, material used, as well as power, water and computer software \nused directly in conducting R&D activities.\n\n121\n Section 2: \nBenchmarking Germany\nThe Government of Germany provides a number of incentives for domestic and foreign \ninvestors in the electronics and micro-technology industry. The Government of Germany’s \ninvestment incentives package provides cash incentives, loans at low interest rates and \npublic guarantees to secure loan from private banks for companies looking to establish \nbusinesses in the country. Depending upon the size of the company, investment location \nand project scope, these incentives can amount to as much as 30% of expenditures for large \nenterprises and 50% for small enterprises.\nThe Government of Germany’s operational incentives package is aimed at providing support \nto companies engaged in R&D. All R&D incentive programs are part of the Government of \nGermany’s four-year high-technology strategy, under which an annual reserve of €3 billion \nhas been provided for non-repayable project grants.\nSweden\nThe Government of Sweden does not provide any specific incentives for the semiconductor \nindustry in particular, but supports R&D activities across industrial sectors in the country. \nPrimary government support is in the form of grants for R&D projects. The Swedish \nGovernmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) is one of the major agencies \nto which companies can apply for R&D grants. The agency’s aim is to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of research activities in the country. The agency’s annual budget to finance \nR&D activities is approximately SEK2 billion.\nOther agencies in Sweden such as the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, \nKnowledge Foundation and Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth also fund \nR&D projects in the country.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry122\nSummaryIV.\nExhibit 29 summarizes the findings of the benchmarking study.\nKey to Exhibit 29\n India is ranked among top three in the sample set; implying best in the \nleague\n India ranks between fourth and sixth among sample set countries; \nimplying average standing among sample set countries\n India is ranked among last two in the sample set; indicating areas of \nimprovement\n Exhibit 29\nSr.no.

It highlights India’s growth and positioning in the \nglobal semiconductor design industry to identify areas of improvement and frame \nrecommendations for the Indian semiconductor design industry. This report is jointly \nprepared by the India Semiconductor Association and Ernst & Young Pvt. Ltd. \nThe output of the study is presented in three sections:\nSection 1: Industry analysis\nThis section throws light on the global semiconductor design and embedded software \nindustry with a focus on the Indian industry. It discusses the ecosystem for semiconductor \ndesign development, the status of intellectual property in the industry and the talent \nlandscape. It also provides estimates of industry revenues, workforce demand and \nsupply, demographics, trends in terms of technology nodes and business models, and \nhighlights the key drivers of and the challenges faced across the following three segments \nof domestic industry:\n• Very large scale integration (VLSI) design segment\n• Embedded software design segment\n• Board/hardware design segment\nThis section also discusses the nuances of the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) market \nin terms of global and Indian markets, their drivers, the challenges faced by them and their \nlicense models.\nSection 2: Benchmarking\nThe objective of the benchmarking exercise is to provide a competitive assessment of \nIndia against seven countries considered pioneers of semiconductor design. Quantitative \nbenchmarking compares various parameters such as industry dynamics, talent pool, \ninfrastructure, operating costs, quality of the business environment, and innovation and IP, \nwhich are all pivotal to the development of a country’s semiconductor design sector. This \nanalysis aims to highlight the challenges India faces vis-à-vis its competitors and the model \nto develop based on best practices adopted worldwide.\nSection 3: Recommendations\nKey issues relating to the growth of the semiconductor design industry are summarized, \nbased on the findings of the Industry report. In the Benchmarking exercise, elaborate \nrecommendations have been made to tackle the issues mentioned above. This will be \na valuable source of data for the Government of India, the industry and academia, and \ncan be used to plan and influence government policies for the domestic semiconductor \ndesign industry, building a strong ecosystem for the industry and bridging the gap in the \ntalent scenario.About this study\n\n133\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Contents \nSection 3: Recommendations\nRecommendations 134\nSynopsis of challenges 134\nDetails of issues and actionable recommendations 136\nRoadmap for recommendations implementation 162\nAddressal of challenges with stakeholder responsibility 164\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry134\nRecommendations\nThe Indian semiconductor design industry is estimated to have contributed US$6.6 billion \nas revenues in 2009 and employs close to 135,000 people in semiconductor design besides \nproviding employment to numerous people by means of indirect labor. The central and state \ngovernments in India recognize the strategic value of the semiconductor industry and have \nproactively made attempts to support the industry by unveiling policies aimed at growing the \nsemiconductor footprint in the country. \nIn spite of the efforts made by the government, the Indian semiconductor industry faces \nchallenges on numerous fronts in terms of competition from other countries, fast changing \ntechnology and increasing cost pressures. To help the Indian semiconductor industry reach \nits potential, government, academia, industry players and industry associations need to work \ntogether to improve India’s business environment. In the absence of such a concentrated \neffort, the industry will fall significantly short of capturing its potential. \nThis section attempts to provide actionable recommendations to the challenges identified \nin the industry study and benchmarking exercise, which involved detailed discussions with \nindustry experts coupled with intensive secondary research. This will be a valuable source \nof data for the Government of India, industry and academia to be used for planning and \ninfluencing government policies toward the semiconductor design industry, bridging the gap \nin the talent scenario and building a strong ecosystem for the semiconductor design industry.\nThe section is studied under the following sub-sections:\n• Synopsis of challenges\n• Details of issues and actionable recommendations\n• Roadmap for recommendations\n• Addressing of challenges and stakeholder responsibility\nSynopsis of challenges\nBased on the findings observed during the industry report and the benchmarking exercise, \nwe have identified a set of 20 challenges faced by the Indian semiconductor industry today. \nThese challenges are presented in Exhibit 1 below.\n\n135\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Exhibit 1: Complete set of challenges faced\nSection Sub-section Challenges\nSection 1: Industry analysis India industry overview • People-related challenges\n• Quality of talent\n• Lack of technical career path\n• Attrition\n• Eroding cost advantage\n• Lack of semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem\n• Competition from China, Taiwan and other South-East \nAsian Countries\n• Protectionist policies adopted by other nations\nVLSI design industry • Lack of R&D funding in universities\n• Lack of scale at the leading node\nEmbedded software industry • Cost pressures due to constantly evolving hardware\n• Integration and testing of software and hardware\n• Skill-set availability for high-end programmers\n• Preference of ADM services as a career option\nBoard/hardware design \nindustry• ►Compliance related challenges\n• Lack of component ecosystem development\n• Adoption of de-risking business models by customers\n• Official policies\nSection 2: Benchmarking Infrastructure • ►Deficient power supply\n• Inadequate logistics infrastructure\nCost • ►High electricity cost\nBusiness environment • ►High and unstable corporate tax structure\n• Low efficiency of legal framework\nGovernment support • ►Expiry of the national level semiconductor policy\nIndustry dynamics • ►Inadequate electronics production\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\nThis entire set of challenges can be summarized under four main issues:\n• ► Issue 1 – Quality, availability and maturity of talent\n• ► Issue 2 – Building a startup and SME ecosystem\n• ► Issue 3 - Absence of a semiconductor ecosystem\n• ► Issue 4 - Lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and implementable incentives\n• ► Issue 5 – External issues affecting the Indian semiconductor industry\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry136\nGoals envisaged for the Indian semiconductor \ndesign industry\nWhile the issues need to be addressed by actionable recommendations, specific goals \nare envisaged for the Indian semiconductor industry to provide a general direction to the \nrecommendations. The four specific goals envisaged are:\nDetails of issues and actionable recommendations\nThis section takes up each one of four issues identified above and discusses them in detail. \nElaborate potential recommendations to tackle these issues are articulated to enable the \nIndian semiconductor industry reach its complete potential.\nIssue 1: Quality, availability and maturity of talent\nResults from the industry analysis and benchmarking study shows that India scores \nwell on current and future availability of talent with 61% of engineers graduating every \nyear belonging to disciplines relevant for semiconductor design. However, this available \ntalent is not readily deployable. As the semiconductor design sector is highly knowledge \nintensive, quality of talent produced is a very big challenge. The launch of the Special \nManpower Development Programme (SMDP) by the Indian government is a welcome step in \nthis direction. Maintain leadership in semiconductor design by \nincubating 50 fabless semiconductor companies, \neach with the potential to grow to US$ 200 million \nin annual revenues by 2020Goal 1\nBuild on India's favorable intellectual property protection image and make it among the top 5 destinations for intellectual property creation in the semiconductor design industry Goal 2\nCapitalize on indigenous demand in strategic sectors to provide impetus to the Indian fabless semiconductor industry Goal 3\nSustain and nurture high-class semiconductor design manpower at a growth rate of 20% year-on-\nyear to double its current output levels to reach a \nworkforce size of 400,000 in the next ﬁve yearsGoal 4Exhibit 2\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\n137\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Recommendations: \nThe detailed recommendations toward facilitating better quality of talent can be summarized \nas under:\nEach of these recommendations is discussed below in detail:\nRecommendation 1A: Feedback on the SMDP II\nAfter discussions with SMDP coordinators, faculty members and Head of Departments \nat Resource Centers (RCs) and Participating Institutes (PIs), the following observations \nwere made:\nObjective: Involvement of more PIs in SMDP III\nSMDP III needs enlargement in its scope to reach out and include more institutions as PIs \nin line with its vision. While SMDP II was a step in this direction with the number of PIs \nincreasing from 12 to 25 from SMDP I, this trend needs to continue with SMDP III.\n• ► SMDP III, if initiated, should focus largely on targeted system deliverables, such as SoCs\n• ► These system deliverables should be designed by multiple institutions\n• ► For the implementation of this program, it should be a collaborative program run on a \npublic-private mode\n• ► To achieve this program, SMDP III needs enlargement in scope to reach out and include \nmore institutions as PIs\n• According to our estimates provided below, 11–14 more colleges must be introduced \nas PIs to bridge the demand supply gap by 2012.\n• The existing PIs can be evaluated and those which have become self-sufficient and \ngraduated to the level of RCs can be promoted, which will ultimately help to expand to \ninclude the 11–14 additional PIs.Goal No. \nAddressedImprovement \nareaIn-depth recommendations elaborated\n4 Talent 1A) Feedback on the Special Manpower Development \nProgramme II (SMDP II)\n1B) Set up specialized institutes for semiconductor design\nType I Manpower 58\nType II Manpower 672\nType III Manpower 892\nType IV Manpower 3849\nTotal 5471\nSource: ISA—EY research 20107,700\nHence, to bridge the demand-\nsupply gap (7700 - 5471), about 11 – 14 more colleges need to be \nintroduced as PIsManpower \ndemand required by 2012\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry138\nLeverage National Knowledge Network (NKN) for SMDP III:\nNKN aims to connect more than 1,500 knowledge and research institutes in the country \nusing a high-bandwidth network. As R&D activities and innovation in semiconductor \ndesign industry require multidisciplinary knowledge, NKN can be leveraged to connect \ngeographically separated high-quality semiconductor design research centers and \nengineering colleges providing education in fields related to semiconductor design.\nThe SMDP module can gain significantly from NKN if all RCs and PIs under it gets connected. \nThe network will facilitate data and resource sharing among all colleges. The workshops \nconducted under instruction enhancement programme (IEP) can take place online, which \nwill increase faculty participation as they are not likely to require leaves to travel to other \nengineering colleges. \nA lot of learning material can be provided online to students, which can be updated by \ninstitutes regularly to include latest technology. The students can leverage the expertise of \nfaculties across engineering colleges and can take up projects under professors in their area \nof interest. The infrastructure provided by NKN can also lead to inclusion of more institutes \nunder the umbrella of the SMDP program. This can prove to be very useful in creating \nworld class semiconductor research institutions producing a pool of high quality design \nprofessionals.\nRecommendation 1B: Setup specialized institutes for semiconductor design\nIndia does not have specialized semiconductor design institutes, which focus on training \nstudents and carrying out research activities. \nRecommendation: Set up four technology institutes specific to semiconductor design \nwith government and industry players as key stakeholders. To begin with, one institute \ncan be setup and based on its success, the other three can be initiated. While providing \nthis recommendation, best practices have been taken from specialized institutes such as \nInteruniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC) in Belgium, VLSI Design and Education Center \n(VDEC) in Japan and the nano-centers setup in IIT Bombay and IISc.\nObjective: The proposed institutes should be set up with an aim to bridge the gap between \nfundamental research taking place in universities and colleges and technology development \nhappening in industry.\n \nIMEC Belgium\nIMEC is an independent research center carrying out high-level innovative research in \nthe field of microelectronics and nanotechnology in Leuven, Belgium. This was set up as \na non-profit organization in 1984. The center has state of art fabrication tools with 200 \nmm processing facility, advanced laboratories for microelectronics research and a training \nprogram for VLSI design engineers. The current development at the center is toward 32 nm \ntechnology node. The organization has approximately 1,750 employees including 550 guest \nresearchers and industrial residents. Revenues for 2009 were €275 million.\n\n139\n Section 3: \nRecommendations VDEC Japan\nVDEC has been set up in the University of Tokyo and is shared by researchers all over \nJapan. The institute works for the improvement of instruction methods for VLSI \ndesign, distributes updated VLSI design-related information, provides CAD software \nand licenses and supports chip fabrications for universities and colleges in Japan. More \nthan 600 research groups and 150 universities in Japan are using services of VDEC.\n Model: Following is the model based on which the proposed institutes should be set up:\nWorking model • Institutes as education centers \nThe institutes will act as education centers and will:\n• Invite graduate engineers to pursue their M.Tech in areas specific to semiconductor \ndesign\n• Offer post graduates in semiconductor design to carry out their doctorate thesis.\n• Offer one-year Executive MBA program for development of project management \nskills\n• Institutes as independent research hubs\n• Will double up as independent research hubs and will aim to become nodal points \nfor the majority of semiconductor research taking place in the country.\n• Will employ design professionals to carry out high level research that will run three \nto five years ahead of industrial needs.\n• Will invite guest researchers from academia as well as industry experts to carry out \ndesign research as industrial residents in the campus.\n• Will also aim to attract foreign nationals to carry out research at the campus.\n• State of art infrastructure \nThe institutes should have highly experienced and well qualified faculty and should be \nwell equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and latest public domain and propriety \ndesign tools.\nFunding and revenues • Initial funding\n• Initially, the government should fund 50% of the set-up cost, of these institutes; the \nrest can be raised from the industry and other investors.\n• EDA tool companies should be invited to contribute in laboratory infrastructure \ndevelopment by providing design tools at a highly subsidized cost\n• Ongoing funding\n• These will be set up as non-profit organizations and will earn revenues by providing \nindustry-relevant technology solutions to companies and academia.\n• The revenues will be utilized for paying salaries to employees and faculty, stipend to \nresearchers and development of state-of-art infrastructure.\nSector and technology \nfocus• Sector focus\n• In the first phase, these institutes should focus on research activities specific to \nsectors of national importance such as defense, healthcare and infrastructure for \ndeveloping high-level design methodologies and new process technologies for next \ngeneration of chips. \n• In the second phase, they can extend their research to sectors such as multimedia, \ntelecommunications, energy and transport. \n• Technology focus \nThe process development at the research level should be aimed at 45 nm and below \ndevices.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry140\nLocation • Locations \nThe institutes should be set-up near the four major clusters of semiconductor design — \nBengaluru, NCR, Pune and Hyderabad. \n• Location advantages\n• These locations will help students obtain live projects and take up internships \nin nearby design units from semiconductor design companies to gain hands-on \nexperience.\n• The institutes can also invite experienced design professionals from industry for \nguest lectures as it will be easier for them to travel to nearby places.\nBoard of Directors • ► Board of Directors should consist of delegates from industry, IITs, IISc, government and \ndistinguished faculty from well established foreign institutes.\nCourses offered • ► M.Tech\n• ► Ph.D.\n• ► Executive MBA\n• ► Short-term industry relevant courses\nFaculty • ► Collaboration with IITs/IISc for faculty exchange\n• ► Collaboration with industry for guest lectures from industry experts. \n• ► Faculty student ratio should not exceed 1:2 for post graduation courses.\nCurriculum and labs • ► Refer to Annexure 1 for details\nIndustry and academic \ncollaboration• Industry collaboration\n• Further collaboration with industry can be achieved by inviting companies to jointly \nconduct research on projects. This will allow these institutes to share cost, risk and \nexpertise and IP with companies. \n• The patents can also be filed and co-owned by the company and institute’s research \nteam.\n• Academic collaboration \nCollaboration should be done with universities/colleges, which teach advanced courses \nin semiconductor design such as IMEC-Belgium, VDEC-Japan and Cambridge University \nfor student and faculty exchange programs. \nThe institutes can also invite eminent professors from abroad especially of Indian origin \nwho can act as mentors for students willing to do Ph.Ds in areas of their expertise.\nLearning and development \nactivities• Employee training \nTraining programs will be organized from time to time to equip employees with technical \nand management skills.\n• ► Short-term courses \nThe institutes will organize seminars/workshops and offer short-term courses for skill \ndevelopment of academia and industry, which will be relevant for different levels of \nexpertise.\nManagement development \nprogram• ► Objective \nThe program will equip design engineers with project management skills essential to \nmanage the research projects efficiently and effectively.\n• Program\n• The institutes will offer a one-year executive Masters of Business Administration \n(MBA) on similar lines as “Visionary Leadership Program in Manufacturing” jointly \noffered by IIM Calcutta, IIT Kanpur and IIT Chennai.\n• The program will run with an aim to impart leadership and management skills \ntogether with cutting edge technology awareness to design professionals to \nproduce next generation of techno-managerial leaders. \n• The program will be targeted to junior and middle-level management professionals \nof semiconductor design companies in India.\n\n141\n Section 3: \nRecommendations KarMic Training Center — a rural semiconductor initiative serving a social cause\nSemiconductor design for senior secondary graduates\nKarMic Training Center, located in Nesargi village, around 40 kilometers from Belgaum, Karnataka is a VLSI \ntraining institute started by Dr. Shivaling S Mahant Shetty in June 1999. The institute has been set up with an \nobjective to offer specialized semiconductor design training to graduate engineers to make them industry-ready \nfor the design sector. This center also provides similar training to senior secondary graduates from rural areas \nof Karnataka who may have not been able to pursue higher education due to financial constraints.\nThe students are given a specialist training for a period of three years as a part of the “VLSI Junior Engineer” \ncourse. Major emphasis is on teaching students subjects specific to semiconductor design with a special focus \non analog design. These students are given a practical exposure to design circuits on public domain tools \navailable in computer laboratories. They learn to design chips used in mobile phones and other electronic \ngadgets. They also work on the projects obtained from semiconductor companies.\nThe annual intake of the institute is 20 students. The students are selected from the academic institutes of the \nstate after an elaborate selection process. They are paid a stipend of INR500 per month, half of which goes to \ntheir parents with the understanding that this money will be paid back by the students once they get employed. \nThe first batch of the students will graduate next year. The model proposes the absorption of these graduates by \nthe Karnataka Microelectronic Design Centre Pvt. Ltd., a company founded by Dr. Shetty.\nThe success of this initiative has not just brought about a rural revolution by unearthing the potential of rural \nstudents in becoming future design engineers; it is also an excellent example of fulfillment of an individual’s \nsocial obligations by paying back what one has learnt from the society.\nRecommendation\nThe government can attempt to achieve rural inclusion in the semiconductor revolution in India by replicating \nthis kind of model and aid in enabling such set ups in tier-III cities and rural areas to encourage senior \nsecondary and higher secondary graduates to take up a career in semiconductor design industry. Faculty can be \nencouraged to take up part-time/weekend courses in these setups.Management development \nprogram (cont’d.)• Program (cont’d.)\n• It will provide a right balance between theoretical inputs and practical training \nto develop high degree leadership skills. The program will offer professionals an \ninternational internship opportunity where they will work closely with industry \nleaders to gain hands-on experience at project management.\n• The institutes will collaborate with semiconductor industry associations of leading \ncountries in semiconductor design such as the US, the UK, Germany and Taiwan \nto invite top management professionals from semiconductor companies of these \ncountries to impart project management knowledge to Indian design professionals.\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry142\nCreate a pool of skilled labor for semiconductor design industry\nApart from design engineers who are involved in R&D activities, semiconductor industry \nalso needs skilled workforce to assist in areas related to VLSI testing activities, embedded \nservices and hardware board design services.\nThe government should consider setting up a for-profit organization through public private \npartnership (PPP) route on similar lines as National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) \nto fund development of skilled workforce for the semiconductor industry. This will be set up \nwith an aim to bridge the existing gap between the demand and supply of skilled labor in the \nsemiconductor industry. \nBoth government and private players will be stakeholders in this venture and the funds will \nbe contributed by both of them. The organization will work to establish vocational training \ncenters to produce a skilled workforce. It will also provide funding to other companies that \nprovide skills training. Alternatively, the government should include semiconductor as one \nof the sectors in its list of 21 identified sectors, which face a shortage of skilled workforce \nunder NSDC. \nOther recommendations toward facilitating better quality of talent apply to the components \nof education and career advancement:\nEach one of these recommendations is discussed in detail below:\nRecommendation 1C - Cultivate student interest\nArea of concern: The semiconductor industry requires specialized skill sets preferably post \ngraduates. However, the number of people pursuing post graduate degrees in India is a mere \n8% of the total relevant engineering talent output in India. The average monthly stipend paid \nto an MTech student is INR 5,000 and that to a PhD student is about INR 9,500, which is far \nless than what a graduate earns in the industry.\nRecommendation: There should be an increased focus on promoting higher education \nat this level by ensuring that students and research fellows get better stipend and other \nperformance-based incentives. This recommendation applies to students following the \ncompletion of higher studies. Post-graduate students, not just from tier-I colleges, should \nbe offered attractive packages by the industry as compared to those offered to graduates. \nAwareness of semiconductor design as a good career option should be provided to the \nstudents by the academia. The GoI should provide incentives to companies willing to sponsor \nstudents for higher education.Improvement \nareaIn-depth recommendations elaborated\nEducation 1C) Cultivate student interest\n1D) Faculty development\nCareer \nadvancement1E) Plan employee advancement\n\n143\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Area of concern: Lack of readily deployable talent in the industry is seen as a big challenge. \nGenerally, the industry provides support by donating EDA tools and equipment. However, \nthere are only a few programs aimed at training the students on this software.\nRecommendation: Companies can help to bridge the gap by providing internships, \norganizing training programs and competitions in order to motivate students to use these \ntools. For example, some companies have introduced Analog Design contest in the past to \nencourage analog system design.\nRecommendation 1D - Faculty development\nArea of concern: The teaching profession in India does not necessarily attract good talent \nbecause of low remuneration, incentives and unattractive working conditions as compared to \ntheir counterparts in the industry or teachers abroad\nRecommendations:\n• Measures should be taken to increase salary bands and other benefits for faculty in order \nto attract quality talent. \n• ► New cadres of professors with more than 15 years of work experience in corporate \nor organization experience should be introduced on the lines of clinical professorship \noffered at some Ivy league institutes abroad\n• ► Faculty should be provided incentives such as establishment/endowment of research \nchairs and provision of fast track promotion schemes.\nArea of concern: Lack of continuous training opportunities for the Indian faculty to advance \ntheir own learning process\nRecommendations:\n• Engineering colleges should invest in providing training to its faculty in order to improve \nthe quality of teaching especially in the areas of analog and mixed signal design as this is \nwhere lack of teaching expertise is cited. \n• ► Colleges can provide sabbaticals to their faculty members for higher education or to work \non industry projects. \n• ► Educational institutions should forge collaborative ties for research with several leading \ninternational institutions, which are considered authorities on semiconductor design.\n• ► Companies should take initiatives such as organizing faculty development programs by \ninviting faculty members to work on live industry projects with a view to foster design \nskills and latest technology know-how among Indian faculty. \n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry144\nRecommendation 1E - Plan employee advancement\nArea of concern: Fresh engineering graduates exhibit an increased attraction towards higher \neducation as opposed to working during the initial years of their career and due to lack of \nopportunities provided by industry, it leads to unnecessary attrition. \nRecommendation: Companies can attract research-oriented talent by providing benefits \nsuch as sponsoring higher technical education (M.Tech, M.S., Ph.D etc.) and providing study \nleaves/sabbaticals to their employees to retain talent.\nArea of concern: Employees have a tendency to advance their career by moving away from \nthe technical career toward management positions.\nRecommendation: Companies need to properly define the technical ladder in order to retain \ngood talent in technical roles. Technically inclined people should be promoted to the position \nof a Fellow, which is a equivalent to a Vice-President and the salary differences are not \nsignificant.\nIssue 2: Absence of a startup and SMEs ecosystem\nGoal No. \nAddressedImprovement \nareaIn-depth recommendations elaborated\n1, 3 Absence of a \nstartup and \nSMEs ecosystemDemand side: Keep aside share of indigenous products in \nsectors of national importance\nSupply side:\na.

Some factors on which these sectors can be \nidentified are the scale of potential demand, rapid pace of technology evolution, etc.\nSpecial tax initiatives can be unveiled for fabless companies who meet the market demand \ncreated. This will have the added advantage of giving rise to other ancillary areas of research \nin this space.\nGovernments are themselves important buyers and suppliers of goods and services. \nHowever, only a handful of countries have signed on to WTO’s Government Procurement \nAgreement, notably, major emerging markets such as Brazil and China are not signatories, \nso their government purchases do not have to be open to foreign firms.\nSome suggested sectors that could be considered are (in alphabetical order):\n• Agriculture\n• ► Avionics\n• ► Clean energy\n• ► Defense\n• ► Education\n• ► Healthcare\n• ► Infrastructure\nIndia-specific products can be encouraged such as smart-meters used in energy, low-cost \nlaptops, low-cost healthcare equipment, etc.\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry146\nSupply side\nA. Provide avenues for seed and VC funding \nThough the venture capital firms are keen on investing in the Indian semiconductor design \nindustry, currently there is very less investment activity seen by these players to the extent \nthat investments in this space are not even tracked by any companies. Technology focus of \nVCs in India is more on the IT/ITeS service companies. Various reasons exist, some of them \nbeing — inability of the semiconductor companies to quickly grow in scale as compared to \nthe IT/ITeS service companies, longer revenue realization period, higher initial investment, \nuncertainty over success of companies, etc. \nThe semiconductor sector needs heavy investment and the cost of capital per employee is \nmuch higher compared to IT start-ups. It is estimated that the minimum funding requirement \nfor a design startup firm with 15 employees is approximately INR30 million in the first year, \ngoing up to INR100 million in three years. The short-term value proposition brought onto the \ntable by these start-ups is not attractive enough to draw investors. Hence these start-ups are \nmostly funded by angel investors. \nSuggested model and seed/VC investment required for that is:\nThis makes a strong case for a government venture capital funding to encourage growth in \nthis sector.\nRecommendations for the Indian scenario\nAs shown in the exhibit below, start-ups require support in the business incubation period. \nIn the Indian scenario, semiconductor startups are currently being funded mostly by angel \ninvestors and VC firms have adopted a more cautious approach. Hence there is a gap, which \nneeds to be bridged by government support.Funding required for one design tape-out US$3–5 million per tape-out\nTotal no. of companies to be targeted for incubation 50\nAverage hit-ratio for a semiconductor design company to \nsucceed1:5\nNumber of companies with the potential to succeed and grow \nto US$200 million revenues10 companies\nTotal investment required for incubating 50 companies US$150 –250 million\nTotal investment required from government @50% of \ninvestment (with the rest 50% to be raised from VC firms)US$75 –125 million\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\n147\n Section 3: \nRecommendations i) Government of India to collaborate with VC firms to provide early stage (pre-\nrevenue) funding\nConsidering that start-ups have a dependence on the government for early-stage \nfinancing, the GoI should invite large international VC firms and those which specialize \nparticularly in seed funding to invest in the Indian semiconductor industry, in various \nfocused sectors, as is the case seen in China and Singapore. \nThe funds for this can be partly provided up to (50%) by the GoI and rest by private VCs \nand should be administered by private VCs. Private VCs are well-equipped to administer \nthese funds as they bring in a wealth of technical and business expertise in dealing with \nsemiconductor companies and also have good market connects, which are essentially \nvery valuable for start-ups.\nThe investment size should be kept relatively high keeping in view the higher funding \nrequirements for a semiconductor design company.\nTo understand the requirements and concerns of VCs, angel investors and term lenders \ntoward providing seed funds, workshops/ road-shows need to be facilitated by the \ngovernment where even semiconductor design startups can be invited.Expansion\nGrowth\nRoll-out\nPrototypeInceptionGestationBusiness\nincubation periodExhibit 3: Recommendations for the Indian scenario\nMaturity\nIPO, \nAcquisition\nBanks\nVC ﬁrmsFounders\nAngel \ninvestors\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry148\nii) Government of India to collaborate with state VC funds\niii) Provide cluster-specific funds\n• ► In order to mitigate risks, GoI should invest its available funds in the ratio of \nsuccess of individual semiconductor clusters spread across India, such as Bangalore, \nNCR, Hyderabad, Pune and Chennai, since companies in these clusters already \nhave proven capability in semiconductor design and have taken a lead in the Indian \nsemiconductor story. \nThe split of funds can be based on a similar ratio of success of various individual \nsemiconductor clusters in terms of revenue/employment generated, in order to \nensure replication of success due to availability of talent and knowledge know-how in \nthese clusters.\n• ► Another criterion for distribution of funds can be to the companies focusing on \nsectors, which have evolved considerably in these clusters. For example, the \naerospace sector in Bangalore or the automobile sector in Chennai.Contribution to state VC \nfunds• Some states such as Karnataka have instituted a fund where the Karnataka \ngovernment is expected to provide an amount of INR250 million, toward a \n26% contribution to the KITVEN IT fund to assist start up semi-conductor \nunits engaged in design and embedded software. The remaining funds are \nexpected to come from the industry or mobilized through the PPP business \nmodel. \n• Discussion with international VC funds suggest that governments in other \ncompetitive countries invest a larger percentage of the fund and then \ninvite international VC firms to fill in the rest of the lacunae. The GoI can \nplay a role here by providing the additional amount or some part of it and \nraise the rest of it through industry. In this way other states can also be \nencouraged to form funds.Some famous established funds instituted by governments \nworldwide\nThe Israeli venture community was instrumental in advising the Chinese to set up guidance \nfunds, similar to Israel’s Yozma program in the early 1990s, in which the government invests \nas a limited partner in the local and foreign VC firms along with other institutional investors. \nIt offered attractive tax incentives to any foreign venture capital investments in Israel and \nalso offered to double any investment with funds from the government. As a result between \n1991 and 2000, Israel’s annual venture capital outlays, nearly all private, rose nearly 60-\nfold, from US$58 million to US$3.3 billion; companies launched by Israeli venture funds \nwent up from 100 to 800; and Israel’s information-technology revenues rose from US$1.6 \nbillion to US$12.5 billion. \nThe recently established Russian Venture Company (RVC) is doing the same to attract \ninternational brand name VC firms to Russia.\n\n149\n Section 3: \nRecommendations B. Setup VLSI specific incubation centers \nTwo types of incubation center models are proposed:\ni. Incubation centers in STPI units\nii. Incubation centers accessible to engineering colleges in Tier-II cities\nCriteria of selection of companies for incubation: Such companies can be identified \nby a neutral body after judging the research and commercial potential of the ventures, \nfocusing on different market verticals proposed to be served by the startups and SMEs \nlooking for incubation. \nGovernment’s support required for tool procurement: \n• To form an Incubation Center Committee (ICC) under the aegis of DIT to overlook the \nimplementation of this program\n• To procure tools from tool vendors at highly subsidized costs and provide them to the \nstart-ups and SMEs, which are incubated. In order to incentivize EDA tool companies, \nthe government can make proceeds from tools as tax-free.\nEach of these incubation center models are further explained in detail below.\ni) Incubation centers in STPI units\nRecommendation: To build an ecosystem of semiconductor design start-ups and \nSMEs, governments should setup VLSI specific incubation centers in the four large \nsemiconductor design clusters in India, in the cities of Bangalore, NCR, Hyderabad and \nPune. Whereas existing incubation centers, which are present currently in STPI units/\nacademic institutions provide for basic physical infrastructure and connectivity, the VLSI \nspecific incubation centers will provide physical infrastructure, connectivity and tools. \nThe key characteristics of the incubation centers in STPI units are as follows:\nSize of centers ►The incubation centers should have a seating facility for 150 people and \nshould not incubate more than 8–10 companies.\nAccess to funds ►The STPI-region specific branches should be empowered to provide a \nsingle-window access for clearance to facilitate hassle-free and timely \naccess to funds to companies looking to be incubated.\nVLSI-specific \nfacilities required►In addition to the usual incubation center facilities, these VLSI-specific \ncenters will require the presence of VLSI design labs and access to various \ndesign tools.\nPayback of funds ►Instead of charging the incubated companies the full cost for the facilities \nprovided, a nominal charge plus an equity share of the incubated \ncompany should be provided to the incubation center.\nPromotion of fabless \ncompanies►A central facility with the presence of characterization, failure analysis or \nqualification lab facilities should be provided by the government, which \ncan be utilized by all the companies present in the incubation centers.\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry150\nii) Incubation centers accessible to engineering colleges in Tier-II cities\nGovernment should consider setting up incubation centers accessible to engineering \ncolleges in Tier-II cities. These centers will provide a symbiotic ecosystem for design \nstart-ups and SMEs, faculty and students. These will provide start-ups with necessary \ninfrastructure facilities and ready access to talent, giving them a platform to launch their \noperations. The start-ups will contribute in terms of training students and faculty on \nlatest design tools.\nIdentification of engineering colleges in Tier-II cities: The colleges can be shortlisted on \nthe basis of:\n• One way is to adopt the participating colleges in Tier-II cities as mentioned in the \nSMDP \n• Existing level of industry interaction with the college. This would help in selection of \nthose colleges, which are above a minimum level in terms of inviting companies to \nthe campus for placements, delivering guest lectures and conducting workshops. \n• Quality of faculty in these colleges, judged on the basis of experience in teaching \nsemiconductor design and number of research papers published\nSetting up incubation center facilities can be quite a complex operation involving \nmultiple stakeholders working together. Following are the key stakeholders identified for \nthis initiative:\n• Start-up and SME design companies\n• Students\n• Faculty\n• Government \nFollowing table lists the roles and benefits available to all the stakeholders.\nStakeholder Roles Benefits\nStart-up companies \nand SMEs• ► To train students and faculty \non latest design tools.\n• ► To provide students and \nfaculty with an opportunity to \nwork on live projects and take \nup internships with them.• ► Incubation facilities: Due to lack in availability \nof funds from venture capitals, start-ups require \nan atmosphere for incubation. These incubation \ncenters will provide the necessary infrastructure \nsuch as office and laboratory space as well as power \nat a highly subsidized rate, which will lower their \ninitial set-up cost. They will also get access to latest \ndesign tools procured by the government at highly \nsubsidized costs.\n\n151\n Section 3: \nRecommendations • Access to talent: Design start-ups face challenge in \nhiring engineering graduates from colleges in tier-I \ncolleges as majority of design talent opt for well-\nestablished MNCs in design space. This model will \nhelp them to attract quality talent from engineering \ncolleges in Tier-II cities where they are likely to \nestablish their operations.\n• ► Reduction of deployment time: There will be a \nsubstantial reduction in their training costs for the \nfresh engineers as the students will receive training \nduring their engineering tenure making them ready \nfor the industry.\n• Leverage on faculty: Companies can leverage the \nskills of the faculty in these colleges by engaging in \nlong-term R&D projects with them.\n• Employee satisfaction: As these incubation \ncenters will be set up in the vicinity of engineering \ncolleges in different parts of the country, the design \nengineers can opt for working for these companies \nestablished near their hometowns. This will help \nstart-ups in attracting quality design professionals \nand reducing attrition rate. \nStudents • Involvement in design-related \nresearch activities \n• Internship with design start-\nups.\n• To work on live projects with \ndesign companies• ► The students will get hands-on experience on live \nprojects by working with latest design tools used in \nthe industry.\n• ► Creation of an opportunity to get employed with the \nstart-ups and SMEs after undergoing an extensive \ntraining during and after their graduation.\nFaculty • To work closely with start-ups \nto conduct research.• ► Faculty will benefit from the industry interaction \nby working closely with design start-ups and SMEs \non various projects. This will result in a continuing \neducation opportunity for them as they will get to \nrefresh their skills and update their knowledge while \nworking on latest design tools.\n• ► Opportunity for faculty to obtain paid consulting \nprojects from start-ups and SMEs.\nGovernment • To identify potential \nengineering colleges in \ntier-2 cities for setting up \nincubation centers.• Talent growth: The colleges in the vicinity of \nincubation centers will produce highly trained and \ndesign industry-ready manpower equipped with all \nthe relevant skills. Thus the government will have \nto spend less amount of money to set-up facilities \nin colleges such as under SMDP to produce skilled \ndesign engineers.\n• Equity stake: Government may consider having \nequity stake in some of these start-ups, which can \nlater be sold and the profits obtained can be used to \nfund other start-ups.\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry152\nC. Tax incentives \nDirect tax benefits\n• Tax deduction for R&D companies could be on a graded scale, based on the \npercentage of revenues that they spend on R&D. A higher percentage will mean that \nthe complexity of the product R&D is higher and hence, it is expected to have higher \nvalue-addition and also a longer gestation period\n• ► Exemption from levy of minimum alternate tax (MAT) for a period of five years, so \nthat they can use the extra cash generated from tax savings to reinvest in R&D.\nIndirect tax benefits\n• ► Extension of service tax exemption to STPI and EOU units similar to that for SEZ \nunits\n• ► Abolition of Special Additional Duty (SAD) on all electronic products and components \nused by the semiconductor industry for a period of 5 years — similar to the present \nconcession for the parts/components/accessories to manufacture mobile handsets, \nincluding cellular phones, introduced in the Union Budget 2011\n• ► The GoI could consider exempting semiconductor units set up outside SEZs from the \nlevy of countervailing duties (CVD).\nOthers incentives\n• Stamp duties: Exemption from stamp duties paid with respect to loan agreements, \ncredit deeds, mortgage and hypothecation deeds executed for availing term loans \nfrom financial institutions notified by the GoI for an initial period of five years. \nFurther, exemption from payment of stamp duties could also be granted for lease \ndeeds, lease-cum-sale deeds for units set up in areas notified by the central /state \ngovernment for an initial period of five years. Registration charges could also be \nlowered for loan documents, sale deeds, etc.;\n• ► Entry tax: State governments could consider exempting entry tax on plant and \nmachinery and capital goods for an initial period of five years from the date of \ncommencement of projects. Further, entry tax should also be exempt for raw \nmaterials, components and consumables (apart from petroleum products) for an \ninitial period of 5 years from the date of commencement of commercial production;\n• Interest free loan on VAT: Interest free loan on VAT could be provided by state \ngovernments depending on the quantum of investments and strength of work force \nin the units.\n\n153\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Issue 3: Lack of a semiconductor ecosystem\nCompetitive countries in the semiconductor industry have a mature and very well-developed \nsemiconductor ecosystem, which in turn, enables growth of the semiconductor industry. \nDiscussions with industry players also suggest that the cost arbitrage advantage enjoyed \nby India today, may not always last and the growth of the semiconductor industry in India \nmay be muted if the other areas of the semiconductor value-chain such as ATMP and \nsemiconductor manufacturing are not tapped into.\nRecommendations:\nThe detailed recommendation for a strong ecosystem development is:\nRecommendation 3A: Promote fabless semiconductor model\nFabless refers to the business methodology of outsourcing the manufacturing of silicon \nwafers, whereas they focus on the design, development and marketing of their products \nand form alliances with silicon wafer manufacturers, or foundries. \nWith process technology being viewed as commoditized and unable to provide a competitive \nadvantage with the exception of memory, continuing down the integrated device \nmanufacturer path was proving to be filled with challenges for many companies and hence, \nthe shift over the last decade was seen toward fabless companies worldwide. There is now a \ntrend seen toward fabless companies moving gradually toward Asia, due to large sustainable \nmarkets as well as the presence of foundries in this region.\nArea of concern: India with its large availability of talent pool in the design industry, \npresence of a market for region-specific products in the clean energy, rural and healthcare \nsectors and Indian companies are being better equipped to provide high-quality software as \ncompared to its Asian competitors, make a strong case for the rise of the fabless industry. \nBut the growth in the number of indigenous fabless semiconductor companies in India is not \nas expected. Apart from a very handful number of players, rest of the industry is heavily \nskewed toward design, resulting in government policies aimed to provide investments and \nincentives to the design industry.\nIndian fabless companies can be defined as, companies with a combination of both, parent \nentity registered in India and with more than 75% of its design workforce operating out of \nIndia. This can be further debated and defined by the government.Goal No. \nAddressedImprovement \nareaIn-depth recommendations elaborated\n1 Ecosystem \ndevelopment3A) Promote fabless semiconductor model – build on \nexpertise achieved in the services industry to promote \nsemiconductor products designed in India\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry154\nRecommendations:\n• Unveiling policy similar to STPI policy for incubating fabless semiconductor companies\nFabless companies selling ICs avail tax benefits in India under EHTP and not STPI. \nBut these benefits are availed only if there is any further value-add from India, post \nmanufacturing. Since these companies ship ICs, manufactured abroad, directly to the \nend customer, they are not provided exemption.\nRecommendations:\nEither of the following initiatives can be taken:\n• Design should be conceived as the value-add and likewise STPI policy can be updated \nto reflect this\n• Fabless companies should be extended STPI such as benefits following the potential \nSTPI policy expiry this year as moving into a SEZ may not be financially viable for a \nfabless semiconductor company, which is less people intensive.\n• Setting up of characterization, failure analysis and qualification lab\nFabless companies in the startup phase are not able to setup these labs in-house \nas they are very cost intensive and hence these ICs need to be sent abroad, which \nis time consuming and hence a big disadvantage for Indian fabless companies. The \ncost of setting up a characterization lab alone can be more than US$ 1.5 million plus \nmaintenance costs.\nLab type Services rendered\nQualification lab • ► ESD and Latch-up Testing and Certification\n• ► Military and Space Grade Qualification\nFailure analysis lab • ► Focused Ion Beam (FIB)\n• ► Emission Microscopy (EMMI)\n• ► Package de-capsulation and encapsulation\nCharacterization lab • ► Phase noise measurement\n• ► RMS jitter\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010Exhibit 4: Fabless industry model\nDesign \nPurchase order Fabrication unit -outside India\nIndian fabless companyATMP unit -India/ Outside India \nWorldwide customerSupply of ICs\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\n155\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Recommendation: Fabless need an ecosystem similar to that present in other countries \nwhere private labs are setup locally. Since the fabless industry itself is in a nascent stage in \nIndia, there are not many good quality labs unlike other countries. Hence the government \nneeds to provide 50% of the total cost towards purchase of proposed equipment while setting \nup the following labs. The remaining funds can come from the industry or mobilized through \nthe PPP business model.\nOther recommendations towards building an ecosystem which is conducive for the growth of \nthe Indian semiconductor industry are:\nEach one of these recommendations is discussed in detail below.\nRecommendation 3B - Promote currently existing semiconductor clusters and \ndevelop new clusters\nAccording to CII, 60% of India’s overall exports come from units in clusters, making it \none of the key drivers of economic growth. With close to 80% of the companies in the \nsemiconductor space having a presence in Bangalore, NCR, Pune and Hyderabad regions, \nthere is a case for the region around these cities to be promoted as hubs of leading-edge \nsemiconductor capabilities, research and development. Promoting clusters has various \nadvantages — increasing competitiveness, sharing of semiconductor knowledge, ease of \nsourcing of components and ready availability of funding. \nThe concept of semiconductor clusters worldwide is slightly different in the context of \nIndia as India lacks the manufacturing foundries, which are an integral part of worldwide \nsemiconductor clusters. The foundries are replaced by semiconductor design companies \nin India. Globally also the definition of semiconductor clusters has expanded to include the \necosystem, which is present within the periphery of hundreds of miles instead of a single \ncampus.\nRecommendations\n• The government should establish institutes specialized in semiconductor research \nsimilar to the Indian Institute of Nano Science (IINS) being setup in Bangalore, Mohali \nand Kolkata and other colleges with specialization in semiconductor related engineering \nstreams in proximity to the clusters in order to facilitate the industry academia \ninteraction and collaboration. Taiwanese government developed Hsinshu park is close to \ntwo of Taiwan’s oldest universities giving it the advantage of skilled labor supply and low \nemployee training costs.Improvement \nareaIn-depth recommendations elaborated\nAbsence of a \nstartup and SMEs \necosystem3B) Promote currently existing semiconductor clusters and develop new \nclusters\nTapping other \ncomponents of the \necosystem3C) Encourage and promote ATMP\n3D) Support dedicated foundries to create devices meeting local demand\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry156\n• Semiconductor companies need a strong supply of components and hence component \nsourcing companies should be encouraged to setup shop in these clusters to ease \nsourcing required for board/ hardware design in required quantities and time\n• To increase collaboration and business opportunities, there needs to be increased \ncooperation with industry clusters which source semiconductors, like electronic clusters \n• New clusters can be developed around a port city such as Chennai or Vizag. The \nadvantage of a port city is vast availability of water and treatment plants. Sourcing of \ncomponents and logistics are also a non-issue due to the presence of ports. Power plants \ncan be setup within the vicinity of these clusters and these clusters can be given SEZ \nstatus to encourage investments in them.\nFamous semiconductor cluster examples\n“Silicon Fen”, as the cluster is popularly known as, is located in the Cambridge region of \nEast England. In 1980s, this cluster produced more patents per capita than the UK average. \nProximity to the University of Cambridge has been a major reason for the development of \nthis cluster. High-tech companies located in the cluster collaborate with related departments \nin the university for R&D activities by setting up research laboratories there. Easy access to \nfinance is another important factor for development of this cluster. Venture capital firms and \nlocal intermediaries provide financial assistance to the firms in the cluster. \nAnother case in point is Hsinshu park — a technology park that houses research centers, \ncompanies and universities within a single campus to promote for a healthy interaction. \n \nRecommendation 3C - Encourage and promote ATMP\nThe ATMP stage completes the last link of the semiconductor value chain. Though currently \nthis industry is very small and in its nascent state in India, with more captives outsourcing \nATMP activities to ATMP units in India and the setting up of domestic testing and packaging \ncompanies, this industry has a vast potential to grow. \nRecommendations\n• Testing being a logical extension to design services and considered to be an industry \nworth multi- billion US dollars, governments should make additional provisions to \nencourage and incentivize companies to set up testing units in India. Labs involved in \ntesting and certifications should be incentivized by government to set shop or companies \ncan join hands to fund setting up of more common testing and certification facilities to \nservice all their needs. \n• Revision of the tax structure and allocation of special ATMP zones in the proximity of \nports will also aid in building this ecosystem.\n• The threshold limit for availing incentives for ATMP units of US$ 250 million under the \nSemiconductor Policy of Government of India, 2007, appears to be very high for ATMPs \nand merits a review to reduce this threshold to above US$ 100 million and up to US$ 250 \nmillion as proposed in the Karnataka state policy.\n\n157\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Recommendation 3D - Support dedicated foundries to create devices meeting \nlocal demand\nArea of concern: India cannot compete with Taiwan or China on the leading node since \nit involves significant investments to the tune of multi-billion US$ and technical know-\nhow, which these countries have gained over the past 20 years. India also faces issues \nin supporting foundry operations since there are infrastructural challenges such as \nuninterrupted water and power supply, easy access to ports etc.\nRecommendations\n• ► The options that can be explored are, creating foundries at “second-to-last” or “third-to-\nlast” technology nodes probably at 90 nm or 120 nm, which require far less investment \nand can cater to local demand in select verticals such as industrial automation, consumer \nsegment, etc. The large local demand, as well as proximity to customers, will ensure \ngrowth of such foundries and make movement of such units to other geographies \nless likely.\n• ► Another option, which can be explored is creating foundries for analog and mixed \nsignal technology. These foundries at 180 nm/130 nm are contemporary to worldwide \nanalog and mixed signal foundries, cost-effective and meet global demands. An added \nadvantage to this, considering that design is the mainstay of the Indian semiconductor \nindustry, is that it may fuel the growth of analog and mixed design industry in India as the \ndesign content in these technologies is of higher value than digital technology.\nIssue 4: Lack of adequate infrastructure, implementable \nincentives and policies, including IP protection and R&D \necosystem\nThe investors look up to the government for commitment to the development of the industry \nthrough equity participation, fiscal incentives and support infrastructure development.\nRecommendations:\nRecommendations to address the issue of lack of adequate infrastructure, policies and \nimplementable incentives are:\nEach one of these recommendations is discussed in detail below.Goal No. \nAddressedImprovement \nareaIn-depth recommendations elaborated\n2, 4 Providing direct \nassistance4A) Protect and promote intellectual property\n4B) Provision of R&D funding initiatives for academia and \nindustry\n1 Providing \nindirect \nassistance4C) Provide infrastructure support\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry158\nRecommendation 4A - Protect and promote intellectual property\nIP offences such as trade secret theft, patent infringement and counterfeiting in the \nsemiconductor space in India are lower as compared to its Asian counterparts such as \nChina, Taiwan and Korea. The GoI has adopted a unique and exhaustive set of legislations \nfor intellectual property in India in line with its prevailing socio-economic and political \nfactors. Customers favor India for its relatively strong IP protection policies as compared \nto other Asian countries. The favorable opinion of customers of semiconductor companies \ntoward IP protection in India can be further leveraged by the GoI and industry adopting \nsome best practices and creating/possessing intellectual property. The focus now needs \nto shift to the next level where concentrated attention on promotion of innovation. These \nrecommendations call for the government, industry and researchers to work together to \nimprove the quality and standard of innovation and its application in India.\nThe following table describes various opportunities to foster innovation in the semiconductor \nspace:\nCreate • ► Encourage Indian entities to develop IP \nEntities involved: Companies, government research labs etc\nRecommendation: \n• Created in India: The GoI can continue with its program for financial assistance of 50% of patent \ncosts instituted through DIT, through a few changes to the policy to facilitate better access to \nfunds:\n• Grants can be forwarded not just to SMEs or start-ups, but to large companies also based on \nthe merit of innovation \n• Filing procedures\n• Reduce the high cycle time for processing patent reimbursement applications applied \ncurrently\n• ► Set up monthly/quarterly sessions for application hearings\n• ► Set up local/zone-wise offices instead of only a centralized office in Delhi, to reduce travel \ncosts and time for applicants\n• ► Encourage companies to present more than one application, if it is the case, per meeting\nCriteria: An exclusive project funding process to be established and administered by the GoI. These \ncan be granted to government or private companies based on the application’s merit and valuation \nby an approved IP valuation committee. Some part of this fund should be expected to come back \nto the government, based on the success of the venture, in the case of for-profit ventures.\n2. Buy • Encourage IP ownership by Indian entities \nEntities involved: Companies, government research labs etc.\nRecommendation: Owning IP is more important to creating value for businesses than just motivating \ninnovation. Incentives need to be given to Indian entities to acquire intellectual property via different \nmeans: \n• Foreign company acquisition\n• Foreign patent acquisition\nCriteria: Government incentives will be based on business case justification approved by IP experts. \nAn Ideal situation is when the applicant is able to establish relevance of the patent to a product that the \napplicant exports to the said foreign country or the product has a large market in India. \n\n159\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Other recommendations towards protecting and promoting intellectual property are \nprovided below:\nProtecting intellectual property\nArea of concern: Generate awareness about India’s legislative and administrative framework \namongst holders about protecting their rights and amongst industry about deceiving others \nof their intellectual property rights and the consequences. \nRecommendations : \n• Industry along with the various forms of government should conduct series of \nworkshops/awareness programs, on line of those conducted by CII in collaboration \nwith state governments, to discuss challenges/issues faced by the IP right holders, due \nconsideration can then be given while framing new laws\n• Companies should conduct regular training sessions for employees to improve awareness \nand imbibe strong IP protection measures, provide for a ‘cool-off’ period between \nprojects of similar nature for different competitors and conduct audits for all projects to \nensure uniqueness of design and patent protection\nPromoting intellectual property\nArea of concern: One of the key challenges in the embedded software industry is to keep \npace with the current technology node which changes every 18-24 months while providing \nincreased functionality at the same or lower cost. \nRecommendations:\n• Companies need to start investing in building libraries, so as to modularize code which \ncan then be reused at a later stage for providing similar functionality. Thus with rapid \nhardware changes, costs can be controlled by utilizing lesser effort due to reusable \ncode to provide increased functionality by the software. The advantage of investing to \nconvert this reusable code to IP is to unlock and generate another revenue stream for the \ncompany by offering IP-based solutions.\n• Industry should collaborate with academia for conducting research in the development \nof common testing platforms and frameworks to enable easy integration of third-party \nsoftware IPs into custom chip development3. \nEncourage \nacademic \nR&D• Encourage Indian Universities to do international quality research\nRecommendations: \n• Incentivize academic researchers to obtain publications in international journals such as IEEE and \nconference participation as part of the PhD evaluation process in India. \n• Provide special incentives to support researchers and research students for patent applications as \nper criteria given in #1 above.\n• Provide special tax incentives to companies willing to set up lab facilities at research institutions\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry160\nRecommendation 4B – Provision of R&D funding initiatives for academia and \nindustry\nSemiconductor technology is growing at a rapid pace and to keep pace with it, the Indian \nsemiconductor industry R&D system should be improved.\nA. R&D funding initiatives for academia\nThe government should consider setting up an R&D fund for the following academia related \nactivities:\nB. R&D funding initiatives for industry\nThe government should consider setting up an R&D fund for the following industry related \nactivities:Improvement \nof laboratory \ninfrastructure in \ntop 45 engineering \ncolleges• SMDP covers 7 Resource Centers and 25 PIs. \n• ► In order to enhance the output of engineers relevant for semiconductor design, laboratory \ninfrastructure for other top engineering colleges, which fall outside the gambit of SMDP, needs \nto be improved. \n• ► This program needs to be extended to 11–13 more engineering colleges by 2012 by equipping \nthem with faculty and infrastructure to meet the demand for semiconductor design engineers \nby 2012.\nParticipation \nassistance for \ninternational \nconferences/ \nworkshops• Grant \nThe government should continue to encourage participation of semiconductor design faculty \nacross engineering colleges in international conferences and workshops. \nThe government should sponsor up to 75% of their travel expenses and 50% of the conference \nregistration fee (if any).\n Criteria for grant\n• This incentive should be made available to all the faculty members who have published at \nleast two papers in the preceding two years in area of semiconductor design in referred \nmagazines/journals of international reputation such as IEEE. \n• In exceptional cases, where the research work has the potential to be filed as a patent, \n100% of travel and registration fee exemption is proposed.\nFunding for research \nprojects undertaken \nby students and \ninstitutes• ► A council should be set-up by the DIT to identify good individual research projects undertaken \nby MTech/ PhD scholars and projects undertaken at institute level. Depending upon the \ncomplexity of the project and the potential idea, the funding should range from INR0.1 million \nto INR2 million. This funding can be partly provided by the DIT and partly sponsored by the \nindustry\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\nR&D fund • The GoI should setup a semiconductor fund of excellence to provide funds to encourage \nprivate companies, who undertake R&D activities for India-specific products designed in India.\n• The fund should cover 50% of R&D costs, including people-related costs, toward R&D activities. \n• The effort made toward R&D by companies should be evaluated by an expert panel of \nacademicians, top Indian leaders from Indian firms and MNCs, as well as invited talent from \nabroad to oversee policy implementation.\n• Based on the evaluations, an award can be constituted for the best R&D project undertaken by \ncompanies in the semiconductor design space.\nSource: ISA—EY research 2010\n\n161\n Section 3: \nRecommendations Recommendation 4C - Provide infrastructure support\nUnavailability of adequate infrastructure reduces the attractiveness of India as a \nmanufacturing destination. As compared to China, India’s infrastructure is in a poor \ncondition. The gap between the two countries is widening every year with China investing \n20% of its GDP in infrastructure as compared with India’s 6%. These infrastructural \nchallenges make doing business in India difficult.\nArea of concern: India is a power-deficient nation and demand-supply mismatch is around \n7%. Cost of electricity in India is high as compared to other countries in the benchmarking \nstudy except Germany.\nRecommendations:\n• ► The GoI should invest in developing more power plants and should encourage and \nincentivize more private players to enter this sector and set-up power projects. Power \ngeneration set-ups and distribution networks need to be improved in order to minimize \nlosses.\n• ► The quality of power to be supplied to manufacturing units should be uninterrupted and \nof a steady frequency and voltage\n• ► The government should provide subsidies in electricity prices similar to those provided in \nthe Karnataka Semiconductor policy to new business set-ups to help them reduce their \noperational costs and become profitable soon. These subsidies can be removed after the \nbusinesses become profitable. \nArea of concern: The semiconductor industry requires world-class logistics infrastructure for \ninbound material and outbound finished products to be shipped globally. India’s ports today \nare already at saturation point and container capacities are almost completely utilized.\nRecommendations: \n• ► This requires upgrading of Indian ports and setting up of a clean room supply chain to \nhandle high-tech electronic components and raw material. \n• ► The government needs to make public investment in additional capacities, invite \nprivatization of operations and further reduce customs clearance times to one or two \ndays (as has China) from the current one or two weeks.\nIn addition to the above recommendations, some other infrastructure incentives which can \nbe adopted as best practices from China are: \n• ► Under a “virtual fab” strategy adopted by some local governments, construction of \na fabrication plant is fully or largely funded by the government but is managed by \ncontracted private firms under a profit-sharing agreement. \n• ► Another instance is, that of The Pudong New Area in Shanghai, which refunds land use \nfees and subsidizes property taxes for pre-approved R&D centers, under the Pudong \ntechnology development fund\n\nStudy on semiconductor design, embedded \nsoftware and services industry162\nIssue 5: External issues affecting the Indian semiconductor \nindustry\nArea of concern: Sustenance of India’s growth momentum against increased competition \nfrom low-cost Asian countries\nRecommendations:\n• ► Unveil new India-specific policies aimed at other industries, which utilize semiconductors \nas sub-components. This will encourage more R&D in the semiconductor space in \nIndia in order to adhere to these policies, thereby converting them into local market \nopportunities. An example is the environmental protection policy in the form of Bharat \nnorms introduced by the government for the automobile industry in India.\n• ► The industry should begin to move away from the standard fixed FTE-based or time and \nmaterial business models and adopt innovative non-linear business models (outcome-\nbased). Output is not directly proportional to inputs in these models and pricing is not \ncalculated based on costs rather on the markets appetite. The industry should also \ninvest in more automation and reusability of code as well as develop IP-based solutions. \nThese steps can aid in reducing costs, improve efficiency and increase revenues to help \nmaintain India’s position vis-à-vis competition.\nRoadmap for recommendations implementation\nProvided in Exhibit 5 below is an indicative roadmap for all the articulated recommendations \nto be implemented in order to aid the Indian semiconductor industry tap into its complete \npotential.

Projected Industry Size and Human Resource Requirements \n2.5.1. Projected Size and Human Resource Requ irement of the Electronics and IT \nHardware Industry \nOur analysis reveals that the Electronics and IT Hardware industry has the potential to grow at a \nCompounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 17% till 2022 and even thereafter considering \nthe fact that the GDP is exp ected to grow at a rate of 7.5% to 8% over this period19. Therefore, we \nexpect the production of Electronics and IT Hardwa re to increase from Rs. 844 billion in 2008 to Rs. \n7,520 billion by 2022. Consumer Electronics, Co mputers, Telecom Equipment, and Industrial \nElectronics would contribute to a large portion of the size of the industry. \n\n19 Our overall approach to macro-ec onomic modeling and for ecasting is explained in a separate annexure \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 42 of 49 \nTable 19: Production in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry in India \nSize of Electronics and IT \nHardware Industry (Rs. \nbillion) 2008 2012 2018 2022 CAGR \nElectronics and IT Hardware \nIndustry in India 844 1,636 4,300 7,521 17% \nConsumer Electronics 226 399 946 1,474 14% \nOthers (Industrial \nElectronics) 119 234 650 1,380 \n19% \nComputers 159 260 852 1,546 18% \nTelecom Equipment 187 478 1,338 1,354 15% \nStrategic Electronics 57 125 344 714 20% \nComponents 96 140 171 1,053 19% \nSource: IMaCS analysis \nThis would translate to the overall employment in the industry increasing from the current level of 0.9 \nmillion to over 4 million by 2022.

Skill Pyramid for the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \nGiven that the industry would required a varied prof ile of skill sets, the following figure presents an \noverview of the profile of skill requirements as de rived from human resource requirements across \ndifferent sectors of the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 45 of 49 \nFigure 22: Skill Pyramid for the Elect ronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\n Source: Industry inputs, IMaCS analysis \n \nThe skill pyramid, in summary, captures where th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry stands \nrelatively in terms of skills (a function of ac tivity, educational requirements, and amount of \n‘preparatory’ time required to inculcate a specifi c skill) as compared to all other industries. \nAs can be observed, ‘Skill Levels 2 and 3’ , have the highest incremental requirement of human \nresource. This indicates the requirement for persons trained in manufacturing, servicing, and sales \nfunctions in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry. \n2.6. Emerging Trends in Electronics and IT Hardware Industry and \nImplications on Human Resource and Skill Requirements \nThe following are some of the emerging trends in the Electronics and IT Hardware Industry: \n Increasing consumption and potential for production: The expected stead y increase in the \nPrivate Final Consumption Expenditure (PFC E) on Home Appliances, Recreational and \nEducation Services, both ranging between 13% and 15%, is expected to drive the \nconsumption and production of Electronics and IT Hardware. This is expected to drive \nindustry/production growth at about 17%, w ith major contributors being Computers, \nConsumer Electronics, and Telecom. \n Sales and Service Ecosystem as a driver of employment: The sales and service support \nfunctions are expected to generate an incr emental employment of 1.2 million persons till 4% to 5% Skill Level 4 (skills which are \nhighly specialised involving \nresearch and design) \nSkill Level 3 (skills which require long drawn \npreparation as demonstrated by acquisition of \ndegrees, and involve highly technical or \nil i )\nSkill Level 2 (skills which require technical \ntraining inputs, knowledge of complex operations \nand machinery, skills of supervision) \nSkill Level 1 (skills which can be acquired with a \nshort/modular and focussed intervention and thereby \nenhancing employability of those with minimal education) 49% to 50% \n25% to 27% \n19% to 21% \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 46 of 49 \n2022. This would be due to a large nation-wi de footprint of tier-2 and tier-3 industry \nparticipants (dealers, franchisees, service agenci es, etc.). This ‘ecosystem’ would contribute \nto a large portion of the human resource requirement. \n Manufacturing has potential for increasing localisation: While a large portion of \nmanufacturing is actually currently a combination of sourcing and assembly, increasing content would be locally manufactured – for example, passive components, certain active \ncomponents, more complex motherboards, increasing adoption of Surface Mounted \nTechnologies and other high-tech areas. Certai n components such as CRT based picture tubes \nmay eventually see a reduction in production given the increasing adoption of LCD/Plasma \ndisplays. Incremental employment in manufacturing is likely to be 1.5 million till 2022. \n Increasing adoption of E-Waste Management (electronic waste management) driven by \nregulation is likely to see more ‘organi sation’ of the industry in that space. \n Global trends such as green and energy efficient t echnology is likely to have increasing \nadoption in India too. \n Increasing contract manufacturing an d stronger OEM-supplier relationships would also be \na key success factor towards developing a bette r ecosystem. There is a strong case for cluster \ndevelopment in this sector. \n Growing segments would be major contributors to employment: Segments such as \nConsumer Electronics, IT Hardware, Telecom Equipment would be major contributors for \nemployment. Illustrative growth categories are: \n• Set Top Boxes \n• Mobile Handsets \n• Plasma/LCD TVs \n• PC assembly \n• End to End IT solutioning - assembling, inst allation, support at on-site and off-site, \ninfrastructure management, emergence of newer technologies such as cloud-computing. \n2.7. Focus areas for NSDC for Skill Building \nThe following are the possible fo cus areas for NSDC for skill building in the Electronics and IT \nHardware Industry. \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 47 of 49 \nTable 24: Focus areas for NSDC for Skill Building \nSkill sets required Incremental \nEmployment (till 2022, \nin million) Possible areas for skill building \nManufacturing 1.5  Basic Manufacturing \n• Basic manufacturing skills \n• Safety norms \n• Meeting pollution control laws, etc. \n• Punctuality \n• Reading circuit diagrams and \npopulating boards \n• Awareness of shop floor, concepts \nof ESD \n• Adherence to cleanliness norms. \n \n Advanced Manufacturing and Contract \nManufacturing operations covering: \n• Quality certifications like Six Sigma \n• Productivity measurement \n• Process control \n• Assembly line scheduling \n• Costing and budgeting \n• Basic management program, \neffective meetings, constructive \nconfrontation etc. \n \n High-Tech Manufacturing \n• Chip Mounted Technologies \n• Complex LCD Technologies \n• Semi conductor Technologies \n• Plasma displays \n• Nanotechnology. \nServicing Support 0.6 to 0.7 million  L1 and L2 servicing/repair of Mobiles, \nTelecom Equipment, IT Hardware, \nConsumer Electronics \n Higher order servicing – L3 and L4 \nrepairs \n \nOther areas: E-Waste Management and Sales \nSource: IMaCS analysis \n\nHuman Resource and Skill Requirements in th e Electronics and IT Hardware Industry \n\nPage 48 of 49 \nThe above two skills sets account for about 70% of the incremental human resource requirement \nbetween themselves.

Background and Objective \n1.1 The Digital India Programme envisions transforming India into a Digitally empowered society and knowledge \neconomy by making available digital infrastructure, digital governance and digital services to every citizen. \nPromotion of a digital payments ecosystem is a natural extension of the Digital India programme and has the \npotential to transform India’s economy by formalization of financial transactions. \n1.2 Financial inclusion is one of the f oremost challenges for India Digital payments promises access to formal \nfinancial services and benefits from e -commerce, especially for those who continue to be excluded. Despite \nsignificant progress in bank -led payment systems, there remained a vast gap i n the availability of basic payment \nservices. Adoption of technology can transform the country into a cashless economy. \n1.3 Finance Minister in his Budget Speech on February 1, 2017 had announced “a target of 2,500 crore digital \ntransaction for 2017 -18 throug h UPI, USSD, Aadhaar Pay, IMPS and debit cards.” \n1.4 In the digital payments ecosystem, merchants play a very crucial role especially in country like India where \nnearly 90% of merchants are unorganized like small grocery stores, local apparels outlets, mom -n-pop stores and \nmore.
